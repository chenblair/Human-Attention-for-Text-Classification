2)Salsa too spicy..but not in a good way.
3)Worst taco 'salad' ever. If you consider only ICEBERG(gag) lettuce, refried beans, and choice of bland meat a salad. The pico, cheese, sour cream n guac all could fit in a tablespoon.  Frozen food style meals.  I've had better Mexican food at Cafe Rio.

It was a late lunch. Beef Bolognese tasted like some had burnt on the bottom of pan. Also did not seem like it was cooked low and slow.  Bread was ice cold and not good.

1,One of the best pho places in the willowdale area. The portions are big. I can eat a lot and I sometimes find it hard to finish a large bowl of pho. The location is close to north York subway station which is great. The food here is not expensive.

From the food, the service, to the decor for the place, everything was handled very well.  as this was the pre opening, I will update this review at a later time to give a more accurate review on food and service.  

cheers!",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 3 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 3 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

however if you spend 7 minutes to place an order to make sure you don't get gluten you better not give the woman gluten.  And so I spent the night holding hair as she lost those flour tortillias.  

They did offer to comp the meal but if you have an allergy that doesn't cut it",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2

0,this place is really going down hill fast....been eating there since they opened and not only is the food now lacking but the service is just flat out bad. Called an order to go today and made 3 stops prior in about 30 minutes and still had to wait on my food. A few weeks ago they completely missed one of our dinners on a take-out order as well.

boring. 

it's just not that cool. the oysters are good though. free appetizers for happy hour on sunday. that's pretty much the only time to go. there's also never any place to sit on a busy night. dumb.

the zucchini pancakes were under cooked and the batter still apparent...and rather tasteless.. Then had a BLT with home made bacon and homemade bread.. Completely boring...

1,"what a different approach to wholesome takeout. I went a few days ago to give it a try, chicken was tasty! however a bit pricey to feed a family of 4. I guess you could say a new look to an already growing market of churracuiras in the city. Unique side dishes, Organic chicken, and interesting menu.
definitely a place to try. Considering going back to try the restaurant menu and eat there.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 3 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
