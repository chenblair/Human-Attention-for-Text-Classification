0,"5/9/2013-  Terrible Service and food!
We had the waitress who wore the hot pink lipstick.  After we were seated took hot pink, 25 minutes to come back to take our order.  I ordered the grilled marinated shrimp-just ok.  My husband ordered the lamb sandwich, next remove the fat and use more meat and the flatbread was stale.  This was not worth the one hour and twenty minutes.  We will never come back again and would not recommend the to anyone.   You are over rated.  Yuck! 
PS the free Thursday crepe dessert (apple streusel) was never served to us as ordered.",0 3 3 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 2 1 3 0 0 3 3 1 2 2 1 2 2 0 1 3 3 3 2 0 2 3 3 0 1 1 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 1 2 2
0,"A case of the least evil. Soup for the pho is great but they really rip you off on the meat.  Last time, i ordered the deluxe, the $12 pho with all of the above expecting what i thought i paid for. One piece of each meat.  And I mean one.  I love the broth don't get me wrong, but there needs to be some sort of reasonable proportion and paying $12 for just straight soup and noodles doesn't do it for me. 

Rip off, but what other choice do we have? Pho in pittsburgh as a whole is awful.",0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 3 3 3 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
1,"A colleague tipped me off to Jjanga...and he wasnt kidding! We sat at the bar(imo the only way to eat ayce) and we just let the chefs know what we didn't want, and they went to town! If you do this I think tipping early helps get the best dishes. The sashimi was beautiful, not what you would expect from all you can eat spot. I live in Portland and this place would ruin all places where i live. I may have to come back tomorrow;)

Yes, most of the people who frequent have a hippy vibe and you feel that when you walk in but everything in this place is delicious. Most of the food is vegetarian/vegan but it is high quality and I have never had anything to complain about. The coffee is amazing (but a bit expensive) and the inside is large enough that you can grab a table and hang out for awhile.

Their banana milk shake is devine. The fish sandwich is pretty good too. Its nothing fancy just plain old delicious fattening Chicago style food.

Unfortunately, service for our group was neglected and we waited twenty minutes for drinks. The $18+ burgers half of the table ordered were over cooked and my Reuben (I love reubens!) was overloaded and saturated with sauerkraut; masking the flavor of the beautiful rye bread and shaved corned beef.

Lobster rolls looked extremely appetizing.. but had little to no flavor.
Wings.. you can tell that these wings were definitely fried for way too long and have been sitting for a bit. Flavor? Waaaay overly salty. Everyone that ordered wings didn't end up finishing them.
Sliders.. I've had better from Dennys unfortunately.

1,"Awesome food by an awesome group of guys!

We came by about 930pm (after reading great reviews about them) and it just so happened that they had just closed for the night at 9pm.

However after a short conversation with Josh, tired as he was....this owner gladly fired up the grill and went ahead and made us a couple delicious sandwiches!!!

The Fluff and Nut Sandwich was epic: Grilled buttered wheat toast with nutella, roasted marshmallows, and Nestle Crunch!! Mmmmmmmmm.....

I wish Goodwich the best, only been three weeks and already talking about more locations? That is AWESOME!!

Ive had some with corned beef and cabbage, some with hot dogs and smoked gouda, and some other ones with like bleu cheese and bacon.  Best tater tots I have ever had.  They have an eclectic little stoner menu for late nights that is priced pretty well.  I suggest you smoke a j and head out here at like 11.  There is a patio outside and you can eat and smoke out there.  This place rocks.

Not a ton of super healthy choices... but there are a few. I love the grilled portobello sandwich, add Swiss cheese and make it amazing. Their beets are yummy, as well as the cottage cheese! My friends are big fans of the chicken parm and the clam chowder. The ham when on special is also yum!THE APPLE-PIE IS AMAzing. It's almost like apple crisp.

0,Been going to Armstrongs for many years and can honestly say tonights meal was terrible. They are pricey but the food is usually good.  I spent 16.50 for six cheese raviolis that did not taste right  and 7.95 for 5 bland and undercooked zuchinnis.  The hoagies were good but I am disappointed with the quantity of the food.  I usually end up with bigger portions that justify the price.  If I end up with another meal like this I can say I won't be back!

1,"Been here a few times, this is one of the best O&B restaurants, and one of my favourite French restaurants in Toronto. Came for Winterlicious this time and we  ordered the beef and sea bass. Food this time was ordinary but may have been the Winterlicious menu. The soup to start was very nice, however the salad was average. Just a large plate of greens, quite bland. Third member of our party ordered the lamb confit. They use the lamb shank, the cheapest part of the lamb, but it was tasty with Moroccan spices.

And I will explain why:

1- This is NOT Italian food.
2- Lobster Ravioli with trace, taste or smell of lobster.
3- Overpriced
4- Nothing Italian about the 
...atmosphere ...decoration or even the music.
5- I tasted 4 different menu items...plus the a desert...still found nothing Italian! 

A bunch of patrons in flip flops and shorts dining in...explains the identity crisis of this place.

When they do they go through the motions as if time were of no consequence.   Food takes a long time to come out now.  It's not fast food so don't think that way.  The amount of time it took for a kid's hamburger with ketchup only to make it to the table seemed to be as long as watching paint dry.

The bar and bar area is cleverly designed in the front of the restaurant. You get a Manhattan feel when the downtown is busy and you are up on one of their cleverly designed front raised tables. Inviting place, great staff. As the ownership of this place are the same team that own Corks and Seasons downtown Oakville, I'm taking a guess that the food will be just as good as the design and decor. Great job.",0 1 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 3 3

Well, I don't know if it was a bad day, the three times I've eaten there; but this is not what you would call quality mexican food. Greasy, over packed with ill prepared ingrediants, dry carnitas and a long wait was not what I was expecting. I was disappointed. And even though I gave it a few more chances, hoping each time it would get better. It did not. So farewell Filibertos.

0,First of all your hours clearly say that you're open until 12am daily but for some reason you insist on closing at 11. So when I go to the drive through at 1045 I don't expect the girl in the drive through to be extremely rude. She literally threw our food out the the window and immediately locked the window and didn't give us the sauce we asked for. This is probably the worst McDonald's in Arizona the people are always rude the food is normally cold the orders are hardly right.

However, my friends really enjoyed their food. They had a DJ playing music. It was way too loud. We couldn't carry on a conversation. As a result we have not returned to this restaurant. The prices for the food are really reasonable, and if you aren't a vegetarian than you will probably love the food here. Try going during the day to avoid the loud music.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Cocktails were interesting twists on traditional favorites.  My wife had the Christmas enchiladas.  Wow. Both the red and green were flavorful and perfectly prepared.

Well, today, my co-worker was raving about the boneless wings and the sauce and I decided to give it another try.  I ordered the boneless wings with honey bbq sauce and onion rings. Both were delicious.  

I would recommend ordering ahead, since I waited 20 minutes for my food.

0,I booked my boss and another manager into this restaurant for lunch today and the feedback upon their return was awful and my boss is a very tolerant man.  He said the waitress was not pleasant at all (maybe having a bad day he said) and the food was unimpressive.  His smoky was more like a hot dog with a caesar salad for $22 a little much.

All in all, I'd say that it's a decent location to watch a game and have a drink. For me, however, the sheer number of TVs was overwhelming and my entire meal felt pretty schizophrenic.

0,"I had the Crazy Burger. Ordered it med-well and it was burnt on one side and tasted terribly bitter from the char. Instead of throwing the burnt patty away, they hid as much of the charred side as they could with the cheese slice. Paid over $14 for a combo- over 4 dollars plus tax to add fries and a drink filled with as much ice as possible. Horrible experience and value. I'm happy to pay a premium for a quality burger meal, but the quality and value were both not present on my visit.

Overall it's a good place to take the family on a budget but, not the first pick.",0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1

Me and my partner ordered a handful of dishes and all of it was greatly presented and most of all they were all delicious. I really liked the Spicy Baja Roll, very flavorful, but not overwhelming. Their Tuna Avocado Salsa Dip was also great, very fresh and the plantains are a great touch, rather then giving you normal nachos.

They also have no idea of portion control when it comes to guac. Which means if you're getting some, prepare for two small avocado's worth.

Although this place seems to have a reputation for bad customer service, my service has been pretty okay overall. Their pricing can be a bit weird at times though.

0,I will NEVER make the mistake of going to this location again or ANY Tropical Smoothie for that matter. I pulled into the drive thru at 6:02 and finally at 6:28 (there is no way to exit the drive through) 26 MINUTES LATER!!! had to drive off without getting my order.

I only got the rib tips and Mac and cheese (which the cashier recommended) but I was fairly impressed. I did only give the 4 stars because I didn't try more items to give a over all review and although the rib tips were tasty it failed to have that crisp charbroil crunch that you'd expect.

It did not disappoint.  It was also conviently located close to the highway.

Came for summerlicious dinner.  The wait staff were wonderfully attentive! They came to our table to explain each meal that arrived and were very receptive to our responses.  The quality of food on the other hand were a different story.  The dinner portions surprisingly small even for the $38 summerlicious bracket.  Desserts and drinks were quite well done but we left somewhat hungry even though our meal had cost the equivalent of a nice knitsweater from Zara.

Hands down one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix and the top 5 best BBQ I've ever had. I have nothing negative to say about this place except you might feel a bit guilty after all the food you will have! The portions are pretty big without the big price tag. A dinner for 3 will cost you less than $50. Great atmosphere and usually good service also.

Everything is fresh, plentiful, and not too crowded.  We came here on Saturday, for an early Mother's Day Dinner.  The raw scallops were great and available.  Everything else was great.  My only problem was the grilled shrimp skewers were undercooked so watchout for that as well as with the chicken.

 Tofu spring rolls and the accompanying peanut sauce is delicious. I can't specifically comment on any other dishes, but the family that I've brought here all love their dishes.

If I had unlimited financial resources I would be flying into town every weekend just to have breakfast here. I see on the website that locations are being added in the Dallas area. YEA!!!

In theory, this place is amazing, but in action, it is not. I'm sad to report that I've eaten there THREE times, despite being disappointed each time. 

The stir fry always tastes as if it's been frozen for a while. The spices always leave me wanting, and the Butter Chicken is blasphemy. For the mediocre food you get, it's quite expensive, though it does fill you up. 

I like that it's to-go, and I like that it's in a convenient location, but there is so much better food on 17th Av, so don't waste your money here.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0

I love Italian food, and have eaten at several Italian places over the years.  And while there is nothing bad about the food at Olive Garden, it sure does not stand out in any meaningful way.

0,Pretty irritated. Drove almost 20 mins from home to here to eat. I didn't feel like late night fast food so I picked this spot. I get to the door and it's locked. Website says it's open for another hour and 10 minutes. Open sign is still lit up. Girl washing the window says they close at 1am.

They are famous for large sandwiches with the fries IN the sandwich, not on the side.  Idea was born out of truckers wanting a meal they could eat on the road.  Yes, if you are in PIT you should probably go once just to say you've been there.  That being said, I have been a number of times and tried a number of different sandwiches and to be honest they all were fairly bland.  Lack of flavor really hurts them in my opinion.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 2 3 3 1 3 0 1 1 0 0 0

The workers all seemed in a daze and were moving extremely slow even when the line was short which ended up creating an even longer wait time. The manager did not make the situation much better when he stepped in to help his cashier along. With his bare hands, he wiped sweat from his forehead, wiped his hands on his pants, and proceeded to handle cash as well as customers' food orders.

""Also last week, Claddagh Irish Pub at the SouthSide Works on the South Side was hit with a consumer alert for numerous health code violations, such as holding multiple foods at unsafe temperatures, using unsafe cooling procedures, and problems with cleaning and sanitization, including a ""black mold-like substance"" on a just-cleaned cutting board and dried debris on knives and pans.

The restaurant was cited for the same problems during two previous inspections this year.

""There is no active managerial control in this establishment evident by repeat temperature violations,"" the most recent inspection report stated.""

1,"This is a great option for every day lunch Thai food.  Probably the 3rd or 4th best thai food in a town where there are 100s of great thai restaurants.  I go there a lot, and there are some amazing dishes.  Crispy Garlic with Duck is the best, and their soups are very good too.

It's dirt cheap for Vegas which is great because food places that sell sandwiches for $6 on the strip is virtually impossible to find. The sandwich itself (got the Original which was roast beef, cheddar, and horseradish sauce) was very good, but a little bit on the small side.

If you're looking for cheap eats that are good definitely check out this place.",0 0 0 3 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 1 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

1,This place is the real deal as far as BBQ. I usually get the brisket because it is so good. It is tender and moist with an excellent smoke ring and amazing flavor. The pork is also very good and the sides are excellent. Good mac n cheese and I love the jalapeno poppers. To add to this I have only had it as take out because it is close to my wife's work. I am going to try to eat at the restaurant soon and update my review. I can only imagine it is better at the actual restaurant.,2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 3 1 1 3 1 3 1 1 3 2 2 2 3 3 1 2 1 1 3 3 0 1 2 2 3 3 2 2 2 0 1 3 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0,This place started off awesome.  Their portions and quality have gone downhill while prices have remained the same.  They started off serving their rice roll order (the ones that come with squid patties) with 3 pieces of the squid patties which were larger than the 1 piece they now serve it with. Came here to eat a couple of nights ago and the rice rolls tasted like they were on the verge of going bad.  Some parts were hard (meaning they had been refrigerated rather than freshly made).  I will be looking for a replacement place for steamed rice rolls.,0 0 0 0 0 2 3 2 3 3 3 3 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 2 3 3 2 3 2 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 2

The only reason why I didn't give this place a perfect 5 is because of the slightly limited game selection at the moment. As well as the semi slow service at times. But outside of that it is great.

Lots of flavor and options to add proteins to salads etc.  The ginger lemonade is very strong ...but a perfect accompaniment to the ginger dressed salads so don't be afraid to try it.  Food came out quickly and was extremely fresh and beautifully prepared/played.  Large portions.

Very casual comfortable vibe.  Eclectic fun interiors. Lots of locals.  All ages.  My teenage daughter commented that all of the male kitchen staff had their hair pulled up in ""man buns""!

1,"Walked in while I was moving to the area for takeout, and I'm pretty impressed. I ordered two larges, and they had them out in about 20 minutes. It came to around $40 with a minor tip.

This joint is simple but you can tell the pizza is legitimate once you step inside. The dough to topping ratio is exactly how I like it (I hate thick dough!).

I'm pretty sure the owner took my order, and he was incredibly kind and helpful in doing so.

A very solid 4/5. Definitely better than chain pizza and some other local competitors.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

I also noticed that the Chinese name has changed. Not sure if I want to try to see if they're open when I'm around the neighbourhood.

1,"We've been going to Northside for years...great pizza, medium-thick crust Detroit style, with a crispy crust when it comes out hot from the oven.  If you like thin crust you can order one too.  Their salads are fresh and crisp and the ranch dressing gets rave reviews from my kids.  The staff claims they make the ranch fresh everyday from scratch.  Great chicken fingers and their fries are always good.  They have sandwiches and pasta too but the pizza is their forte.

The service is still great, but the food quality has seriously deteriorated.  I don't know if they are using a different supplier, but the filet was very poor quality on our visit tonight.  It had little flavor (odd for Outback), was fatty, and had a sirloin texture, as opposed to a buttery, melt in your mouth filet texture.  It's alright to try and cut costs, but for a ""steakhouse"", the steak is not the place to cut quality.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 1 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 3 3

I can't really judge the service since a buffet is all-you-can eat. But I can say that the food was either overcooked, or really dry. Dinner for adults was $29.99 per person and for children it was $15.99. 

I rather pay $29.99 for a decent entree at some restaurant and get full at the satisfactory level than stuffed to the point that you wonder why you decided to eat there in the first place.

The food was very bland and incredibly over priced. Atmosphere was good and service good. Food sucked. Definitely not like a traditional Korean restaurant, where the food is much better and tastier and the prices are way less expensive. 

My cousin's order wasn't so great either. ""This doesn't taste so great, but at least I'm eating healthy"" was her comment to the very low low sodium levels in both our dishes.

For a place opened late, it's great to just get your tea/snack and continue your journey, but the first time I sat in there I felt as if the cashier was annoyed at me being there.

The lighting is dim, the food displays are sad and I feel like I'm just bothering them when I come in, even just to order and leave.

Definitely not a place I would bring my friends.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 1 1 3 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3

Ordered the French Toast and Bacon.

The bread they use for the French Toast has a tougher crust, so a lot of the batter didn't absorb into the bread. Making each bite kind of half bread, half french toast. It also wasn't cooked properly and had some parts which were basically just batter soaked bread.

The Bacon was cold and obviously not made to order.
