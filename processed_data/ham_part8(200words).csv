1,"A little ""slice"" (pun intended) of NY in Vegas! This is some tasty pizza and highly customizable, great for splitting with friends. Lots of selection if you don't happen to be in the mood for a triangular piece of heaven. 

I've been here a few times now and have never had a bad experience. The slightly crunchy thin crust pizza is cooked perfectly each time; it's great but not super filling or overwhelming like some pizza can be. From peppers to pineapple they have any topping you desire. They use fresh mozzarella on the pizza so it's not oozing with a thick layer of cheese (a positive in my book), rather there are spots of cheese all around the pizza. The salads are enormous and wonderful. My favorite is the Caprese. You'll definitely want to share one of those bad boys. 

The outdoor seating is awesome when the weather is right and the indoor seating feels like an Italian grandmother's kitchen, dough flying through the air and pizza ovens hard at work. There's also a little bar with TV's you can plant yourself at as well. The staff is very nice and attentive. A great outing for lunch or dinner!",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 3 1 3 1 2 2 1 1 1 1
1,"AGHHHH This place is GREAT! I'm not as big of a fan on their Sunday brunch though, but everything is great, especially their TAPAS!!!

Last time I went there, I re-orgasmed over and over again. You have to try their steak tips tapas dish. Hopefully it's still there. As the steak tips met my lips, my heart began to sing, and fairies and sparkles started falling out of the sky in a beautiful, sexy, and delicious array of love. It was so good, I wanted to regurgitate each bite, just so that I could taste the deliciousness once again. It also had smoked bacon and feta mixed in, which made me want to take off my clothes and dream of simpler times. 

PLEASSEEE, please go here, and try to stick with tapas, their regular food is good, but their tapas are ahhmazing!!! only downfall though? Pretty expensive-i think we might've blown about $100 on tapas and there were only three of us.

Anyway, 

please go here and indulge on what may be a gateway to a magical land of rainbows and smiles, and angels singing to you as wish that the chef could accompany you along the path of life.",0 1 1 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 3 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 3 3 0 3 2 1 2 0 0 1 3 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 1 0 2 1 2 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1,"AMAZING and not hard on the wallet! 
We went here wanting some good chinese food, without shelling out our entire mortgage payment for the other fancy chinese place here in MGM. So glad we did. Has to be some of the best food Ive ever had. I really wanted the General Tso's chicken, but I cant ever eat it because I cant have even slightly spicy food. I mentioned this and the waiter said ""we will make it for you, not spicy at all"". So you can tell here everything is made from scratch! And it was delicious!! We also had the crab fried rice, AMAZING. And so ""clean"" feeling. You didnt walk out of there feeling nasty and all weighed down by preservatives. Sake was good as well. Between my husband and I we shared those 2 plates as our meal and still left food on the table. Their portions are big. Dessert menu was great, but we were just too full from dinner. Out of all the places in Vegas we went all week, this was by far my most favorite meal.

0,"Absolutely disgusted and disappointed with a recent experience at Marben.  I called for a reservation 2-3 weeks in advance for myself and 8 business colleagues from out of town.  The reservation was booked and I was assured a great spot in their ""hot box"" (apparently this is something special).  When I called the morning of our reservation to confirm, the guy tells me they are closed for renovations!  I then frantically tell him about my reservation.  He puts me on hold and never returns.  I call back and of course he avoids my call and it goes into their message service.  Here's the thing, the outgoing message stated nothing about renovations occurring.  WTF?!  Who does this? If it wasn't for me calling the day of the reservation to confirm, it would have been disastrous for me, (i.e. me and 8 fellow senior execs from out of town showing up to a restaurant that's closed). How embarrassing!  Thank God for le Select Bistro. We booked there instead and had a wonderful experience.

Marben: Ya blew it with a passionate Toronto foodie.

0,"After going there recently for lunch, I'm really surprised at the overall 4.5 star rating. We got two sandwiches, two drinks, and a side of hashbrowns that was just a thin potato patty ($2 extra!) for $36. It was insanely expensive for what we received. 

Neither of us liked our meals. I got the salmon, onion, cream cheese, caper bagel sandwich. Everything about it was clunky. The onions were cut too large, the salmon was not the highest quality and it was also cut into huge pieces. They use a heavy cream cheese instead of a nice light whipped cream cheese that was spread so I thick, I had to take some off.  Not one ingredient in that sandwich was of high-quality and everything kept falling off. It was like a teenager with no food prep skills was in the kitchen that day.  I saw the two people making food that day...and they weren't teenagers.

Not to be mean, but their name on that day could've been 'clunk box.' The pictures on their menu are much better looking than what they're actually serving. I'm giving two stars for the location and the cashier who was incredibly friendly, helpful, and bubbly.",0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1,"After wassailing between 4 and 5 stars, it seems 5 stars is much more appropriate considering the group didn't eat one thing they didn't like and we ate there two nights in a row. 

One of Tom Colicchio's feature restaurants doesn't simply aspire to make great food. They start the diner off with an extensive wine, whiskey, beer and alcohol menu. Although very few wines find themselves south of $100 a bottle, a few great buys can be found to complement the meal. And if you are a scotch, bourbon, whiskey kinda guy (or gal), the list is almost too exhausting to review. 

As far as the food, in one word, decadent. From the charcuterie plate that could be a meal in and of itself to the whipped potatoes that seemingly have as much butter/cream as potato (in a good way) to the baby carrots drizzled in local honey to the steaks (all phenomenal, but we split the Wagyu Flat Iron), the group enjoyed every bite. Add a finishing layer of monkey bread, a cinnamon roll on steroids with velvety scoops of ice cream, and you may just need to retire early instead of testing your skills in the casino.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1,"Airport concession stands are notorious for taking advantage of their clients.  They know they have a captive market and the people being held prisoner by TSA cannot leave the terminal easily to get real food.   So they serve the cheapest, highest profit margin food that is barely edible but good enough so the health department isn't called in daily. 

However a new trend has developed because of this....main stream restaurants are now opening up storefronts at the terminal serving excellent food and catering to the demand of the passengers because the airlines have stopped serving food in coach.

ASAP California Pizza Kitchen is one of these new storefronts and is EXCELLENT.

I had the grilled BBQ chicken salad.   On a bed of lettuce were chuncks of BBQ chicken, diced tomatoes, corn, black beans, onion, lots of thin tortilla strip chips.     Overall a very tasty meal.

I also noticed the sandwiches which were served on focaccia type of bread.   People around me eating them were very pleased with the quality.

In addition, the flight attendants on board the plane highly recommended ASAP.    They especially liked the Oriental Chicken Salad.

1,"Another one of my favorite places that I have to fight off the urge to eat there three times a week. I want to be careful not to get sick of it which would be devastating!

I love the yellow curry/pork and the pad Thai/pork. Ordered many times, consistent and very good! 

I have found that pad Thai is the key to a good Thai place. Been to many all over the place. Some places it just looks, off, and smells, hmmmm off, but this particular place it is just ""fresher"" I don't know how to describe it. This place serves as my standard for pad Thai quality so yes, good food and love it.

Also, ordered the fresh rolls many many times. The ones with avocado (girlfriend doesn't like meats) we have had many times. Huge and very yummy. I like the open end with the lettuce hanging out, nice touch because you can see that the fresh roll is in fact ""fresh"" before you even bite into it. Love it.

Recommended! There are other locations, not positive about affiliation, but I always go to this one and never disappoints.

Down the street and around the corner is a Wendy's with their Chicken Nuggets and Triple Double Classic.  Sonic is turning out dog meat on a bun, and you are not satisfied with your choices.

Once you get to the end of the street you see a different kind of place.  A place where the marketing machine of Madison Ave hasn't touched it.  It is a piece of Americana, all but extinct except for our part of town.  Our Cleveland.

Swenson's is as good as it is nostalgic.  A simple Drive-In joint.  Take away the catchy jingles about ingredients, the stupid crown, and Dave Thomas and you find an authentic hamburger.

0,"Attached are photos of the server smoking and playing on his phone outside of the cafe while there were three tables of customers inside.

From the reviews this place has gotten, we were quite excited to try it but were disappointed by its lack of attention to detail or customer focus.

The server that was on duty was playing on his phone most of the time. We ordered a few appetizers, didn't get sharing plates, or spoons. When we wanted more napkins and looked for him, we found that he was outside smoking and playing on his phone. 

We took the hunt into our own hands, but really couldn't find any napkins anywhere. We waited for about 5 more minutes then we grabbed him from outside.

Definitely don't think that this is the typical experience the cafe wants to offer, however it's quite horrendous when the person who's supposed to be manning the place just leaves the building and the customers within it... to smoke?! 

And last but not least, the food and drink were just okay. The glassware they used also had a giant crack on it.

1,"Awesome Sushi addition to the area.  Huge upgrade from the horrible Friendly's that used to be here.  Great renovation job inside shows no signs of the old Friendly's decor.  Very cool vibe.

Sushi selection is very impressive and will satisfy casual to hardcore sushi fans.  

I'll compare it to Eez Fusion, as it's just a couple miles down the road and is of a comparable quality.  They have the big fancy rolls that people are used to Eez.  Really well put together stuff, with high quality fish.  They also hit all the basic rolls, nigiri, sashimi, etc.  

The menu is way less contrived than Eez, which is nice.  It's not trying to be a Sushi/Hibachi/Mongolian/Thai place.  It's just trying to serve good sushi.  

Family friendly as well.  Nice kids choices.  Our kids got the kids california rolls, cut to smaller pieces.  It came with fries and even a scoop of ice cream.  Good ice cream, not the cheap stuff.

If you're looking to avoid the crowds at Birkdale and Eez, this is well worth heading one exit south to Gilead Rd.  

Also, had a nice looking bar area with several flat screens and soon to be getting Sapporo on tap.",2 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 2 3 0 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 1 0 2 2 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

I usually order pick up at the Ballantyne location, but I called this location on accident to order one time. A girl answered the phone and when I told her I wanted to place a to go order I was put on hold. When another server answered she barely gave me time to say my order and rushed me through the order, not friendly at all. At the end of the order she stated it was the East Blvd location and before I could respond (realizing I had the wrong location), she hung up. So I called back to be polite and cancel my order and the girl on the phone was very rude and snapped back at me ""that's why I told you it was the east Blvd location"". It took everything in me not to be rude back but instead I hung up. I have been serving for over two and a half years and I have never spoken to a customer that way. Very disappointing and rude.

1,"Been a little while since the last sushi exploration.

This place wasn't too far from home and had great reviews, so it was a no brainer.

Appetizers: Baby Octupus Skewer, Bacon Scallop Skewer, Tuna Poke, Mushroom boy, and Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna.

All delicious. Highly suggest them all.

Mushroom boy is a deep fried mushroom filled with cream cheese and spicy tuna. No further explanation necessary.

On to the rolls.....

Philly Roll, Hawaiian Roll, Chicken Teriyaki Roll, and Vegas Lasagna.

Normally, there'd be another roll and 2-3 nigiri orders but. We tapped out. Today our bellies could not withstand AYCE as usual. But it's all good. We'll be back for sure to try everything else we missed!!

The service was very quick and on cue. Always ready to serve you and refill your drinks and take your plates.

Ambiance is laid back and cool. Love the bar and how big it is. Plenty of space for the 96 rolls you're gonna order.

They have some amazing sauces on their stuff, and just enough.

They have the news and sports on while playing top 40/EDM

Not my #1 place, but it's a great sushi option. And REALLY good for groups.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2
1,"Been a member since October, love the place! We live 40 minutes away and it's worth the drive and the $25 membership fee for all you get! I see people post that it's too far away to join, well, it's worth it for us! Each month we get 2 free comedy tickets (and I'm constantly winning extra ones) so the hubby and I are guaranteed one date night a month. 1 hour of free bowling which we use after comedy show to ""bowl away our buzz"" and drive responsibly. Free movies Monday-Thursday for up to 6 people so our family of 4 can always be found in the back row at the 6:00 Monday kids movie. Free kid's meal and $5 game card with every adult entree! Our bill is around $26 and with a generous tip, we usually spend $40 (I keep in mind all the free stuff I'm getting and tip the servers well since we're regulars-they take care of us; we take care of them!) Still, $40 for 4 dinners, 4 movies, and $10 in game cards is a crazy good deal!

0,"Been there twice for brunch and loved it.  So I took my friends there tonight.  The entrees were good; but the Italian wedding soup I ordered was ""offensive"" tasting.  The broth was clear and dark; the vegetables in there were raw or just 10% cooked, unlike traditional Italian wedding soup having all the flavor of melted veggies; the broth does not have any depth of flavor but pure saltiness; the supermarket Italian wedding soup was far better and just costs fraction of the price they charge.  I called the waitress and returned the soup.
My dessert ""warm apple"" something rather was very offensive tasting as well; there was no flavor in the apples; no sugar, cinnamon or nutmeg added;  the crumb was not browned enough to be crunchy; the only good thing was the vanilla bean ice cream, but I know they didn't make that.  
Very disappointed at the soup and dessert, I think a 10 year old can cook better than that.   I am thinking this might be a lack of management issue that they allowed this kind of poor quality of food to be served at a I considered high end restaurant.

1,"Biwon Korean BBQ and sushi is by far the best all you can eat sushi spot we have found in Las Vegas. Biwon Korean BBQ and sushi is our new sushi find and i dont think we will be going anywhere else for sushi. The staff is very friendly and Sushi chef Jay is awesome.
 
They have two sides the sushi bar side and the Korean BBQ side. They have all you can eat sushi for $21.95 for lunch and $24.95 for dinner and all you can eat Korean BBQ for $18.95 for lunch $22.95 for dinner. And if you're really hungry  you could do all-you-can-eat both Korean BBQ and sushi for $23.95 for lunch $29.95 for dinner.

The BBQ side is very busy and there is always a wait. We always eat on the sushi bar side because we come here for sushi, so we get seated fast. 
The corn cheese is out of this world.  my family loves the garlic tuna. and the Teriyaki side is delicious. The Japanese lasagna is delicious. The crunch roll is delicious.

1,"Breakfast Magic (cheddar and bacon waffle-goodness) and the Benny (poached eggs with ham and crab on a waffle) were delish! I would have preferred the crabmeat to have been served warmed as part of the sauce rather than chilled, but that's just me. Also, my first poached egg was refrigerator-cold and cooked through and hard to the touch. I understand par-cooking poached eggs, but that was one that wasn't even warmed! It was replaced ASAP with an over-easy egg that was obviously freshly prepared. Our server Jen was so genuinely nice, poised and attentive in the busy swirl of brunch! Love the contemporary interior design especially the combo of chartreuse and black/brown; it was modern and contemporary but still funky and cozy. I really liked the glassware and china choices: plain and elegant and sturdy with sleek lines. The booths and comfy chairs complement the table placement and the window treatments were simple, modern, unfussy and fresh. Good diverse music at the right level--electronica and singer- songwriter kinda vibe. The menu offered a great variety to choose from especially the balance between sweet and savory and waffle and not-waffle.

0,"Came here on a Sunday night with two other people. There was no staff near the entrance then suddenly 3 people yelling, asking us how many people. Ordered a sushi combo and pork bone soup and it came pretty quickly (the Korean sides as well). The kimchi tasted a little funky (either really old or too fresh). The sushi didn't taste super fresh. The pork bone soup was good but also average. The food here is a little pricier than other places down the street. 

The server never came to check on us. We had to try several times to get her attention. We wanted refills for our other sides and we had asked her 3 times. She came back one time asking what she could get us and we asked for the sides and water as we had already requested it and she never came back with it. In the end we finished our food and just wanted to leave. 

The service just isn't worth the trouble. The restaurant wasn't busy by any means when we were there. The food arrived promptly but was just average at best.

1,"Chompie's is delicious.  I always use their call ahead so we don't have to wait (since they definitely are busy on the weekends).  This weekend they seated our party of 13 Sunday morning as soon as we got there.  

Bustling, animated and fun- Chompie's not only offers high quality breakfasts and lunches but a dynamic, fast-pace for dining.  You may need to wait a little bit for your food since they get so busy- but that's part of the experience.  Just keep busy with the various football games displayed on their tvs throughout the restaurant. It's nice too that you can walk through the restaurant and the staff gets to know who you are- that sure doesn't happen at big chains. 

Personally I enjoy their coffee over ice with hazelnut creamer, Chompie's egg breakfast with loose scrambled eggs with american cheese on top, and their everything bagel with olive pimento cream cheese.  Their potato pancakes are incredible with sour cream and apple sauce.  Yum. 

Gretchen is by far their best server with her 100% accuracy for orders and her charming attitude.

1,"Chow Chow is a cool Southern food takeout place on Madison Avenue in Lakewood.  Walk in and there is a cool kind of older Southern vibe from the dark wood, the large menu board and the decorations.  There are 4 tables, but its primarily takeout.  Once you make your decision you place your order at the large window, pay and wait for the food to come out.

I had the Fish and Chips.  I got a very large portion of perfectly fried catfish; the fish was tender and sweet with a crunchy coating.  They manage to make this still feel light and completely free of any excess oil.  The generous portion of homemade potato chips were crisp and slightly salty, very nice.  I was expecting something tangy from the charred lemon tarter sauce, while a nice rendition of tarter sauce, I failed to find anything unique in the flavor profile.  The slaw was also nice, but nothing unique or special.

Overall the main items were perfected versions of fried catfish and chips; the side items were OK, but nothing special; the portion size was very generous and could easily be shared by two people.

1,"City Cafe has the best breakfast in Lawrenceville, even better than Coca Cafe. Everything on the menu is vegetarian, but even meat eaters will find most of the dishes to be hearty enough for their tastes.

The menu is mostly limited to omelets and wraps, but honestly, everything is prepared so well that I don't mind. The cafe is more or less a one man shop and everything is made to order so his menu compliments the atmosphere of City Cafe--small time, simple and fresh.

I'm always discouraged by the lack of people dining in what I consider to be one of the best breakfasts to be found in the vicinity. The owner is nice and the atmosphere is calm and quaint, perfect for a simple, quiet breakfast and conversation. I learned today, straight from the owner's mouth, that he was probably not going to renew his lease in 11 months, instead opting to move back to his regular location downtown.

His reason? Not enough foot traffic and not enough business. Give it a shot, try their fresh squeezed lemonade, their hearty vegetarian soups, their delicious coffee, their milkshakes, their omelets, their wraps, their egg dishes...try ANYTHING!

I've tried a grilled salmon salad and the salmon was so over cooked it was as tough as beef jerky and seemed like it was reheated from the day before.   I ordered a chicken salad sandwich one time and it is supposed to come with pickles, but it had no pickles so the next time I ordered it I added in the comment section, ""Please do not forget the pickles"" and they charged me .75 cents for the pickles that it is supposed to come with.  The chicken in the chicken salad is cubed processed meat and I got horribly sick after eating it.  I refused to eat here ever again!!!!

1,"Decor was really hard to look at... especially with so many tables, crowds, and really dim lighting so I paid no attention to that.

Servers are really great people, they are humorous and really do tend to your every need!

Food was fantastic, I thought the food sizing was fair... small-medium sized bowls really fill a person up. I shared a Ionized Seafood pasta (I think that's what it was called) with my boyfriend, and we were both stuffed. However, the prices should not be so expensive, so I took off one star for that. As a group we got the flaming cheese... that was a cool show but honestly the cheese portion you get is very small, it resembles a piece of cheese pizza, but the small size is reasonable, since it is cheese!

Overall, a good Greek restaurant to go to if you want great food, and have some extra money to spend. And yes, they do break plates, you will usually hear tons of plates breaking on the plate-breaking days. If you want to break one, bring someone who is celebrating their birthday, or have a special occasion to announce.

1,"Definitely a place to drink. And sadly, I came on a day that I didn't want to drink. My brother and I came upon this place hearing good things about it. I, wasn't hungry (surprised?) but my brother was so he got a meal and told me to order some appetizers. 

We ordered the mac n cheese and the buried treasure which was covered in beef, cheese, on top of waffle fries. They were delicious. The mac n cheese wasn't bad but the only problem I had was it was a little on the salty side. Though, I didn't have a good beer to wash it down so that's probably why it's a little salty. If you have some alcohol with that I bet it would taste awesome.

The service. Not bad. When we went in there it was during late afternoon so it was sort of dead. But, that doesn't matter when the waiter was nice and offered her favorites on the menu that made our decision for what to get. 

All in all, I would come here to drink and eat.

1,"Despite my experience at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino on 1/4 I came here for dinner with my guy and another couple from a wedding we attended earlier that day. I have always loved Hard Rock because I'm a huge rock and roll fan and love going to a place that plays great music and music videos and has memorabilia hanging. 

This location, like the others, was outstanding like the others I have been to previously. I can't remember our waiter's name but his name tag did say Shaggy. He was so friendly and just hilarious! He had great suggestions on food and drinks and we talked about music. He even brought over the very nice music manager who took requests from us and played them. I had requested Simple Man by Lynard Skynard which they didn't have but they had the Shinedown version so he played that. The rest of what we requested, The Doors, Hendrix, etc were all played. 

I had duo fajitas and they were really good. The seasoning was amazing and the char on the chicken was perfect. All in all really great food and atmosphere.

0,"Dined here after reading all of the rave reviews of this place. 
Had pretty high expectations and wanted to love it. 
Unfortunately, will never eat here again. 

If I were the kind of person who'd consider panda express to have the best Chinese food or olive garden to have the best Italian food then I'd prolly consider this place to have the best sushi. 
That's the only way I can describe it. 
It's like the panda express of sushi. 

We didn't get the AYCE cuz, well, we don't do AYCE sushi. 
Tried to order some nigiri but they didn't have any really good types of fish. 
Just the standards: tuna, salmon, yellowtail. 
So ordered a couple of rolls with various fish selections. 

Nothing was remarkable and the salmon was slimy.

the service was all but non-existent.
we sat at the sushi bar and were ignored by all 4 sushi chefs which would be forgivable if the bar was full but there was only 1 other customer there.
4 chefs to 3 people.
hm.

it seems as though they have quite a loyal following which is fantastic for them and i hope that those patrons continue to be just that, loyal.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1,"Ever since this place opened up, I have been eyeing it every time I've driven by. I finally decided to give the place a try!

The outside is in a little bit of a rundown plaza but in the inside it's pretty typical restaurant style. The inside isn't anything to write home about.We ordered straight off the menu but they do offer a lunch buffet! 

I ended up starting off with the chicken 65. It was different in an undecided if I like it way. The previous chicken 65's in other restaurants I've eaten have always been fried in a way. The chicken here was sauced up. Granted the sauce was alright but it's the one thing I wouldn't order again.

Onto the main courses! My husband ordered the butter chicken and naan while I ordered the Chicken Vindaloo with saffron rice. All these dishes were scrumptious! The serving sizes here are pretty reasonable.  I ended up with leftovers for the next day and you know what? It was still delicious!

Final verdict? I would come here again maybe even take part in the discount on take out services their take out menu says.

The management there is obviously not very qualified and cannot run a proper fast food establishment. I hope that once this location gets sold they actually hire better management and crew so that you don't continue to loose all of the loyal customers. The location has such a high turnaround rate that every time I go there are all new faces. On this particular visit I had to repeat my order of 2 grande meals (7 hard tacos 7 soft tacos, and 6 bean burritos) at least 6 times only for them to give me a messed up order I ended up getting 10 being burritos five hard tacos and five soft tacos. This is ridiculous and I do not feel like driving back up there but I will be sure to contact the district manager and the store manager and complain about this ongoing issue.

1,"Exceeding Expectations.

I felt I needed to update my review on Miracle Mile Delicatessen.  After a recent posting on yelp about my dining experience at Miracle Mile I was contacted by Josh,  Business Manager at Miracle Mile.

Josh and I spoke about my dining experience and at the end of our conversation I felt great. After my convesation with Josh I now know why Miracle Mile has been in the valley for over sixty years. A philosophy of tradition, pride, excellent customer service,and great food is why Miracle Mile stands out.

Customer Service, in my opinion, means exceeding  expectations. All of us  expect a certain level of service, and some expect more than others. However,  when a business EXCEEDS those expectations, it should be acknowledged and that is exactly what Miracle Mile has done, they exceeded my expectations.   

In my oponion,  that is what I call the  ""WOW"" factor.  It's not often that I find myself saying ""WOW, I didn't expect that"" or ""that was beyond what I expected"" but thanks to Josh that is exactly what happened.  

THANKS, again  Josh for caring about the experience your customers have at your restaurant and a special thanks for the gift card!",3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 1 1

Obviously after coming here frequently for those 2 years not all my meals were perfect and I've had typical fast food issues like messed up orders or messy tacos or whatever but it's expected from all fast food but all issues here were handled greatly. Idk if it's because Every time I ordered my drink I said bah-jah but they always recognized me and were happy to see me which made my visits nice wether I was getting off work or drunk at 1am. They have some really
Great people working there and I hope they are all fortunate to move on to bigger and better things, restaurant can be cold if you dine in and bathroom had no mirror which are the things I noticed. Some new guys working there seem zoned out but they perform the job adequately.

0,"Food here is run of the mill. Ordered a veggie burger with an onion ring, lettuce and tomato. Fries were included as a side. Since we were traveling as a large group, we had pre-selected meal options which were provided on a limited  menu. Our group arrived slightly early due to weather rearranging or schedule for the day. 

Pros:
-Food was served quickly with very short wait times for meals to be served.
-Service was efficient and organized
-Food was okay
-Excellent atmosphere, views and fountain outside... Also located in a great area.

Cons:
-Unclean silverware brought out twice, server finally returned with plasticware (not by request)
-The attitude of our server was abismal. She was short with our group from the time of entry. Her attitude was truly among the worst that I've ever encountered when dining out. All requests made were dismissed abruptly. 
-Was initially brought out the wrong burger, even though a veggie was ordered
-Wasn't even offered a refill of drinks

With a city full of local staples, this is probably not on the top of the list. Especially considering the prices and service issue.

  As far as restaurants go, Bobby Q has the look of an old industrial factory with a touch of western thrown in. The interior is a combination of wood, steel, glass, concrete, exposed pipes, ducts, and wires. At first it may  look like everything was thrown randomly together, but everything fits in a modern organic way. The overall  effect is entertaining. Your eye drifts from one area  of the  room to the  next.
  Now  the food. For lunch I had their combination platter consisting of the ribs, brisket, and chicken. And as expected, the food looked good. It smelled good. And it tasted even better.  It was hot. It was  tender. It was tastey. But what suprised me the most was the chicken. It held it's  own against against the ribs and mighty brisket.

1,"Gluten-free spelt rotis made fresh and filled to the point of bursting with incredible curry flavour.  You can find a better roti in Toronto, but if you find one closer to my work, please let me know!

The melt-in-your-mouth goat curry is my usual order, but the chicken is awesome and the channa and spinach is so good and perfect for when you're feeling a little vegetarian. You can ask for spinach on any of the rotis, and I heartily recommend it. You must try the chicken/beef/vegi patties, they are so fluffy and the filling is seasoned perfectly.

There are all kinds of Caribbean drinks including Malta, Coconut Water, Ginger Beer, Ting, Mauby and Peanut Milk.  Have a beventure!

Once in a while they will have fresh doubles, but never before 12, and they go quickly.  This is classic Caribbean fast food and they are awesome, and if you get the chance, try them!

Island Foods also sports a full selection of ice cream including sour sop, mango and rum butter.

1,"Got there around 11am on a Sunday for brunch.  They quoted us a 45 minute wait but the actual wait was more like 30 minutes.  We sat outside which was fine as it was 80 degrees and sunny outside and there's an umbrella over the table to shade us.

I started out with the Watermelon Kiwi Lemonade.  The drink looks awesome as the bottom half of the drink is green and the top half pink.  The drink had the perfect mix of sweetness and tartness and made a perfect compliment to the heavy food.

I decided to go with the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles.  The fried chicken was tasty and not dry.  You got 2 large chicken breasts along with 3-4 waffles which came pre-syruped and with bacon stuffed in the middle.  The waffles went well with the fried chicken but I wasn't too impressed with them.  Overall I was satisfied and the portions were beyond huge.

I also got to try some of the Pork Tenderloin Benedict which was tender and not overcooked even though the meat was pounded flat.

It was almost $18.  So my expectations were high.  Big mistake.  My mocha was brought out with a bitter espresso taste and no chocolate.  That is until I finished it.  It was all at the bottom.  Damn annoying!  They brought out my omelette with potatoes and toast.  The omelette was so dry and tasteless it was like eating a large rice cake with meat chunks.  The potato's had no seasoning at all.  

Then after about 45 minutes my friend and I got the stink eye with a weird Damien Omen smile from one of the staff while we were chatting.  I won't be back-ever.

Lastly, when you pay by credit card they ask for gratuity and make the selection set up so it's difficult to not have to select an amount.

0,"HORRENDOUS customer service. LOUD, grating environment with endless shouting. 

This 1-star review is because of the attitude and the mouth on the main cashier, clearly a New Yorker in his 40's. When we ordered our food he was not very friendly, which is the ""authentic attitude"", I suppose, but as my dine-in experience progressed, his volume and language became increasingly outrageous. 

Three times he apologized on the phone for mistaking orders; he referred to another unhappy customer as ""a bitch with the tiramisu"". 

Twice they made my girlfriend the wrong pizza. TWICE! Then, when she asked for the garlic knots we ordered, he mumbled under his breath ""I'll kill you"". EXCUSE ME??? You'll kill your customer for asking for the food we ordered!?!? 20 seconds later, our garlic knots arrived, still hot, indicating that they were sitting in the kitchen and possibly not served to us on purpose.

I will not be patronizing a restaurant with this level of abuse in customer service. ""Authentic New York-style"" or not, there is NO EXCUSE for any of this cursing and venom.

The pizza was ok, garlic knots were good, but I'd advise that you order online if you must have this pizza.",3 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 3 1 1 3 1 1 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 2 1 1 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 3 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1,"Had the kale caesar to start and the buttermilk fried chicken (like apparently the majority of customers). The salad was very good and the dressing not too overwhelming. I especially how the made the substitute with kale, as it adds a good satsifying crisp to the taste. They gave a strawberry shorbet between the appetizer and entree as to clean the palette.
The buttermilk fried chicken was amazing. I've never had fried chicken at a fine dining establishment and it was a very refreshing experience. I'm from the East Coast so I might not have the most reliable comprehension of what the best fried chicken is but it was ridiculously good. The batter was very smooth and thin. The meat itself was very tender and had a distinct juicy flavor which went perfectly with the light gravy that came with it. I wish I could remember it honestly. Writing this review made me so hungry that I had to stop in the middle to eat something. Anyway, the waitress mentioned how the restaurant is owned by two sisters for a very long time and one of them does all of the baking.

*Brunch Review*

The below experiences are true for me as well as the people I've dined with. 

I only get one dish for brunch. The French Toast Platter. Twice I've received cold, wet, egg saturated pieces of bread. 

Egg dishes are supposed to come with a biscuit. Can't tell you how those taste because I never seem to get one. 

The bacon, oh the bacon. The bacon on more than one occasion has looked like gnarled pieces of flash fried beef jerky. I don't know what the deal with that is. But hey, sometimes they do you a favor and forget to give you bacon altogether. 

Waited an hour for food most recently and 2 hours the trip before. I thought that was a fluke as the manager or someone explained they were short staffed.  Methinks not. 

I guess my recommendation is to come within an hour of opening for brunch or you may be in for a long wait for subpar dishes with missing items. 


1 Star for Jalapeño Cheddar Grits and the Roasted Potatoes because they are they only enjoyably edible parts of my brunch 99% of the time.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 2 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1,"Hands down the best plain slice you can have in Oakland. The cheese has a nice sharpness and deep flavor. The sauce is perfectly tangy without being sweet, and surprisingly tastes like real tomatoes. The crust is crisp and has a bit of a salty bite to it. These three factors contribute to a thoroughly enjoyable pizza-eating experience.

Non-plain slices vary. The Spinach, Tomato, and Ricotta white slices are absolutely wonderful. Their spinach actually has flavor, the tomatoes are fresh, and the creamy ricotta compliments the tangy crust and salty cheese excellently. Their topped slices and pies actually have plenty of toppings, unlike some other pizza joints in Oakland (cough Pizza Sola cough). Mushrooms taste canned, which is not very pleasant.. Pepperoni is average, I prefer Sola's. 

Other menu items again vary. Hoagies are average, there are better places in Oakland for that.  Calzones are based on the same great crust so they're pretty solid.

Good, quick, and friendly service for the most part. My major qualm is that it closes pretty early and that it isn't open on weekends.

Overall, easily the best spot in Oakland to grab a plain or spinach slice. Forget the competition, Milano's is king.",0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 1 0 2 2 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0,"Hands down, the WORST service I've ever seen. Arrived and we're seated. Good so far. Adam was our server but he was busy so someone else took our drink order. Good so far. We ordered crab but the other two in our party ordered salmon and catfish. About 20 min in Adam returns and says that the fish will come out after the crab. No worries,  it takes longer etc. 30 min in the fish arrives. 5 min later oyr crab arrives but its wrong. Plain with no seasoning. Back it goes. After 5-10 min I tell the inlaws to eat so it doesn't get cold. 45 min after ordering still no food. Adam finally stops by and says ""no food?"" We explain and he returns 5 min later with the same food we turned away about 20 min prior. We explain why it's wrong. He comes back 5 min later after just throwing some spice in. It was cold and not remotely appealing. We never got drink refills. At one point he saw my empty cup near the edge for refill,  grabbed the ice tea and walked right past us.

1,"Honestly, I kind of went into the Metro Grill not expecting too much. Probably because I've never heard of anybody having a mind-blowing experience at one and I only ever hear complaints. However, on a quest to try a few more elevated patios, this was pretty close to my apartment so I figured, why not? Impressed, I was.

The food was above average, we had the fish tacos and the number 42, which was a Asian lemon chicken dish.  Upon questioning why the dish has such a strange name, the waitress actually asked the chef. Apparently, the lemon chicken is no. 42 on the menu of a majority of Chinese restaurants. This of course isn't true, but the fact that the waitress actually asked the chef for us was a testament to good service. 

Furthermore, the fact that the staff managed to get the patio ready just hours after a major rainstorm passed through the city shows how hard they work. That impressed me as well.

The Guinness was fine and the view from the patio onto 17th (thought you may have to maneuver around some potted plants) was nice.  

All in all, a good experience at the Metropolitan Grill.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 2 2 0 2 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0

Their sandwiches are decent but their customer service is the worst!!  I use to pick up breakfast for a co-worker and myself a few times a month because it was right next door,  and they forget something EVERY SINGLE TIME!! They would charge me, of course, but then lie and tell me they didn't, even though I had the receipt!  I work in the industry so never made a big deal about it, I gave countless chances and excuses.  Until finally, I just stopped coming in.  I came in one more time after a year, again, for convenience, and they forgot the bacon on my sandwich.  When I went back in, they said they were out....That's fine, BUT WHY CHARGE FOR IT?!?  They have over charged me every friggin time and have forgotten something (no exaggeration) EVERY TIME, unless I check and go back.  But the worst of it?  They're never are apologetic or try and make it right, or ask me to come back in for a free coffee even?

We realize it's the bar, but we were yelling at each other across the table due to the music volume!  Our waitress took our drink order, delivered outlet drinks quickly, took our food order, then never came back to our table.  An appetizer was delivered quickly by another server, then shortly two of our entrees were delivered by yet another server.  The third entree wasn't delivered and out waitress was no where to be found.  After another 10 or so minutes, I flagged a bartender down and asked to have the last meal checked on.  Finally our server showed at our table and explained that another server had taken the entree to another table.  She apologized and took another 8 to 10 minutes to bring out the meal.

0,"I a bit confused with the rating here... I can see why it got some good reviews as well.  It's super convenient to downtown but I found it a little lacking.  

Let me preface that it was a Thursday... and I wanted to grab lunch with a friend at an ""off peak"" lunch time... towards 1pm.  We walked in and we were told we could sit wherever we wanted, the place wasn't really that busy.  Couple people playing pool and some (maybe 3) other tables had some people sitting down.

Server was friendly but very rushed... must have been either recovering from the lunch rush or just multi-tasking, but he definitely did his job in getting our order in.

Not sure why it took very long for our sandwiches to come out of the kitchen... maybe short staffed that day?  or something else, but I wasn't too thrilled with the quality of my sandwich and fries.  Not that the food was in-edible, but just a little sloppy.  Not something I would have expected for the price they were asking for.

I may try them again, but I wasn't too thrilled during lunch.  Maybe their speciality is during games and evening....",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1,"I absolutely adore this place, its honestly probably in my top 3 for food places in Pittsburgh. I first discovered this place during my internship last summer and I've been coming ever since. From the atmosphere to the portions do the variety and quality in their menu, there's nothing negative that I can think of when it comes to describing this food joint. I usually am one to order the Gaprow Lad Kao or the Pad Thai but there's an assortment of other items on the menu that are sure to put your taste buds in a euphoric whirl. Their range spice levels (ranging from 1-5) allow for even the most sensitive of pallets to enjoy their food and their lunch and dinner specials are enough to fill up the largest of tummies. The two things I would make sure you make note of though if you plan on dining here is that 1.) They do not do reservations for lunch at this location, only dinner and 2.) This place gets packed relatively quickly, so if you plan on sitting down and enjoying your meal in, definitely try to come in earlier rather than later, especially for their lunch hour.",2 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 1 3 3 3 2 3 3 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 1 2 3 3 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1,"I am not a hot dog connoisseur. I'll be honest. I mostly dislike hot dogs.

Growing up, our family tradition was to eat a hot dog on New Year's day. My mom (and grandmother before that) would say you'd be guaranteed to have money in your pocket year round (and that every meal after would be sure to be better). I ranked this ""tradition"" right up there with the mandatory liver and onions dinner once a year. 

Well, I must confess: since Dottsy Z. introduced me to Great Dane's I have craved and enjoyed a chili dog on my own volition on more than one occasion. 

The soft poppy seed bun provides a pillowy home for a the steamed dog (which could be grilled upon request) that offers a nice mild flavor with the famous snap. The chili is an excellent compliment providing a nice additional texture. All a this and yummy skinny fries for under $5? At that rate, I really do have a shot at money in my pocket all year!

So, my hat is off to Great Dane's for doing what my mother and grandmother were never able to do: eat a hot dog and enjoy it!",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 1 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 1 0 3 3 0 2 0 0 3 3 2 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1,"I am very glad that a Filipino restaurant of this quality opened in the east valley.  My wife and I live in Gilbert and we take time to go here regularly. Here are the reasons why we love this restaurant. 

1. Cleanliness. This is the most important thing for me. That place has to be clean. The tables and everything else are kept clean. I give them 5 stars for keeping the place clean. Keeping a restaurant clean is actually hard. They do a great job. 

2. Taste of food. Definitely 5 stars. The first 28 years of my life was in the Philippines. I have been here in America for 20 years. My wife and I eat out everyday. So you can imagine that we have eaten out a lot. We never go back if we are not satisfied. There are many options out there. With Nanay's we come back over and over. 

3. Service. Everyone takes time to make sure you get what you need. There's enough cold water all the time. Staff are very friendly.

1,"I am writing this review mostly because I don't think the others are fair to this restaurant.  I have been a patron since it opened and visit usually once per month.  I have experienced nothing but friendly, accurate and speedy service.  Therefore, I was surprised to read that others apparently haven't had the same treatment.  

Mary Brown's fried chicken is not as crispy as KFC or Popeyes.  However, the meat itself and not just the coating is, overall, tastier than the aforementioned chains.  Mary Brown's has arguably the tastiest chicken breat pieces for those who are fans of white meat.  Because their marinade is likely some sort of brine, in my experience, their white meat pieces have never, ever been dry.  What is also notable about the way they prepare their chicken (unlike all other chicken chains I can think of) is that all pieces are trimmed of excess fat and skin prior to preparation.

For those wishing to try their signature dishes without spending a lot, they have daily lunch specials under six bucks.

Everyone has different prefernces.  However, taking process and care into consideration, a fried chicken ""foodie"" would probably understand why Mary Brown's has a loyal following.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
1,"I came here with my fellowship for dinner last month. Located up a set of stairs, I wouldn't have known the restaurant was there unless my friends had told me. Inside, it was set up (at least to me), like a cafeteria with rows of benches and long tables. The interior looked neat, clean, and urban. 

The food was great! I tried my curry with minimal spice because I know I can't handle spicy food, and I loved how it tasted. My friend got the seafood fried rice and shared some with me. It was great! I hadn't really tried Thai food up until then, so this was a good food experience to my taste buds. 

I won't be coming here regularly because of the busyness which slightly turns me away (sometimes the wait time to get a table can be extensive without a reservation, but it goes to show the place is popular) and price tag but I recommend that every Ryerson student (since it's right by school) should try Salad King (and Chipotle, Five Guys, Panera, Bam Nhi Boys etc) at least once.

0,"I came here with some girlfriends to have some drinks and appetizers before our Bingo session. Yes we are 80 years old and play bingo. If you sit in the bar area, you can take advantage of their happy hour, for appetizers and drinks. Appetizers are $6 each and certain draught beers are $3.  The appetizers we chose were:

potato skins
pretzels
bbq chicken flatbread

The food took a long time to come out, and when it did, many of the items were cold as if they had been sitting for a while. The potato skins for example, were super crunchy, but not in a good way. More like stale crunchy. The pretzel sticks were probably the best thing, they were like breadsticks that looked and tasted like a pretzel. They came out buttery and warm. The cheese sauce that came with it was not very tasty though. The flatbread was mediocre at best.
I ordered a wildberry lemonade to drink and that was the best thing I had there. The ice comes crushed which is my favorite.

I ordered online and was hoping to pick it up right away and leave as I was in a hurry. When I got there no one was there in the take out room to help us out. Another 2 customers had come behind me and still there was no one to help us get our orders. I had yelled ""excuse me"" probably 10 times and waited 15 minutes before someone came in to help us. Once she was there I got my Food quickly. The take out area itself was dirty and disorganized. The price of the food is extremely ridiculous but I guess it's alright for the taste of the food. I ordered the mini pizza and mini pasta that's for kids cause it was cheap lol. It was 6.99 and comes with a drink, toy, and brownie. The pizza tasted good but the pasta could have been better.

As my first visit to the actual mall itself, I found it quite nice. The mall has an overall funny layout, as most of the stores are on the upper level and an odd Y shape. Found ourselves going around and visiting the same areas a few times before turning around. 

Enjoyed that lots of stores had a larger store space and some stores that other malls don't have like Urban Outfitters, Muji, and White House, Black Market. The stores here gave off more of a higher end vibe, similar to Yorkdale. 

Parking wasn't all that bad, as there are parking lots and structures all around the entire mall, with many entrances and exits. Makes entering the mall area and leaving it simpler. 

My friends seemed to like this mall, as there are stores here that you don't typically see elsewhere.

1,"I cannot even express how much I love this place! After my injury, this has been my 'go to' for sushi and it never disappoints. Be sure to call and make an order or it may take a while if you order there. A lot of their business I would want to say is for take out since their sitting area is quite small. I personally have not tried dine-in but I am sure the food experience would be great. 
In regards to the food, I absolutely love their spicy salmon and black dragon roll. I recently discovered the Kamikazi roll which is salmon, avocado and spicy sauce which is perfect since I love avocado! Another yummy choice would be their shrimp tempura, it is just so good I order it every time. I have tried their sushi combos and they are great. Their fish to rice proportion is just right so you won't complain. 
The prices at Sushi Park is very affordable and fair. The quality is high and the service is awesome. We had stumbled in a little late once and the owner was super accommodating.

There's another buffet that serves food by the spoonful, and its wicked that one would even mention them in the same category.

I liked the steamed crab legs and the fact that they offer real butter on the side was a plus. There was nothing else that really stood out. The sushi rolls were blah. Soups were salty. Mac and cheese lacked flavor. Baked chicken was undercooked and very pink inside.The oysters (Blue Point) were pathetic. What are they doing? Shucking them and putting the leanest ones out there? It looked that way compared to the Blue Point oysters that we enjoyed at another hotel. 

Also, the service was horrible. The excuse was that they were understaffed that day. We waited 15 minutes to get sodas, and never saw anyone offer a refill during our visit. Unacceptable. This is the world famous Caesar's Palace on the Las Vegas Strip. If they want to compete with some of the 5 star/diamond caliber places within walking (staggering) distance, they need to step it up.

 I might give them a second shot, but there is less than a 50% chance that I would even bother.",0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 2 1 1 2 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 3 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 3 0 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0,"I eat a lot of Chinese food and love trying new places, even if not new foods. My standards are a beef fried rice, sweet and sour pork, and General Tao's chicken. Some places of course do it better than others...

That being said, this was one of the others. I found the rice to be rather dry and not fresh. The sweet and sour pork was decent but quite fatty. The General Tao's was not even a little spicy but it was a nice flavour and the chicken itself was good. The prices of all were a little higher than normal as well which can only be accredited to the money that went into the decor.

It was one of the nicer looking Chinese restaurants I have visited in a while. I have been used to the low quality tables and chairs thrown into a room that was probably not intended to be a restaurant. That was probably the only thing worthwhile about the restaurant as none of us were impressed with the food or the service.

The server was very friendly and attentive, she came to our table in less than two minutes after we sat. She gave us time to place our orders and was very thorough in Describing what to expect from the dishes. 

Our food was served in a timely manner, however in between our food being served the waitress made sure we were comfortable. Our food was exactly as she described. I ordered the shrimp and chicken jambalaya, it was awesome! If you like spicy food I definitely recommend. My mom ordered a shrimp dish that she enjoyed. However my sister ordered the lobster salad; the lobster was overcooked. The manager immediately took it off the bill when he learned that she was not satisfied with her food.

The Ceviche was simple but did have fantastic tostones served with it(I recommend they add a little heat).The empanadas were my favorite with a light crust and fresh chorizo.

Artsyarti has taught me in previous classes how to make works of art that I was very proud of and ended up creating a ""cat wall"" at my house with the paintings. Artsyarti walked us through every step and walked around assisting in each class (which was incredibly helpful). I am disappointed to report that this class did not go that way. We were barely given direction on how to draw princess Leia and when it came to painting everybody was on their own. I really debated posting about this but I saw that the next class will not be with Artsyarti and because of that I will not be attending again. Artsyarti is an amazing teacher and an amazing artist!

The food is better than your average bar food... We got the tater tots (which were delish!) and I had the buffalo chicken sliders.  The bread that they were on was incredible! It was some kind of Asiago bun that was so fresh, soft, and flavorful that anything on it would have been perfect.  The chicken was very spicy, so people who don't deal with spice beware! I love spice though so it was great for me.

1,"I have to say that Le Village Buffet is one of the top buffets in Vegas! I was able to try so many new things in one sitting- I really liked the fresh cut lamb, eggs Benedict, grilled eggplant, and the creme brulee... I could go on and on. The size of the buffet isn't the biggest, but I have been to a lot of buffets in Vegas, and this one stands out above the rest with the food's flavor. I really was blown away with most of the food's taste. The crepes are made to order, and the cooks are very nice. The dessert station was a little lacking compared to other buffets, but they make up for it with all of the breakfast and lunch foods. 

The atmosphere is very nice. It is set up like a small village with many secluded sitting areas inside of small ""houses"" and you go ""outside"" to get the food. 

Never before had I been able to eat crepes, duck, lamb, and crab legs in one meal.

1,"I hired AB to cater a private event in my home and I actually had guests follow the servers throughout the party...my guests couldn't resist snatching up more tasty morsels (even though there was PLENTY of food to go around)!!!!  Amazing catering. Truly.  I've tried other caterers and they were good, but not AB great.  Professionals!  Food is amazing!!!  
I've also attended social events where AB was the caterer. They were able to pull it off amazingly well with such a large crowd.  Quiche is exquisite!  
Most recently, I had the opportunity to try their version of tacos at the Arizona Taco Festival at the Salt River Fields and, BY FAR, they were the BEST tacos (but those are not on the restaurant menu...just saying...these chefs are versatile!!!) 
Since moving to East Phoenix, I still make the trek for myself and for any out-of-state visitors of mine because I know they need to try this special place.  This place is that good.  If it is high season (winter) please do not expect immediate seating or seating at all.  This is a quaint bistro that many many many people love.

0,"I just moved here from south Florida and have been having trouble finding authentic spanish food up here. I heard this place was good and I saw picadillo on the menu so I got excited. The sangria was really good but the picadillo only had 1 olive in it. The olives are my favorite part so this was disappointing. I would have said something to our waitress about this but we only saw her a few times. The service was pretty terrible as our waitress only came to our table to take our order and bring our food and drinks. We had to flag her down to ask for boxes and the check at which point she asked if I wanted another sangria. I would have ordered another sangria if she came by our table at some point before we were sitting there for 15 minutes trying to figure out how to get out of there. Also, the live music was too loud to have a conversation with anyone so my boyfriend and I just sat there the entire time staring at each other once we got frustrated trying to talk to each other and not being able to hear.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0,"I keep telling myself that I will never go to another branch of this franchise, and yet I did. My mistake. I blame myself. I never ever have a good experience at any of the locations I've been to. I truly believe there is something wrong with their training and business model.
Yes, we had a big order this time. 15 smoothies. I did expect a long wait. But I also expect a certain level of competence from their staff. They advertised a ""Buy two get one free"" special, but somehow they forgot about this and charged me for all 15 drinks. It was such a fiasco getting the difference refunded as well. After some long debate, the manager (who wasn't even onsite) finally approved a refund.
And after the long wait, (and to make a long, ridiculous story short), we ended up getting only 14 drinks. We counted everything in front of the person who took our order and they could not figure out which one was missing. At this point, we lost patience because we were there for over an hour so we just left.

1,"I like coming here to chill and to get a bite to eat. There's always room to sit somewhere, and the staff are all super friendly. If you stay in and order the staff will bring food to you. 

I have the panera card. I go here at least once a week and I'm always getting something for free! Whether it's a coffee or a pastry.

I love the pastries and the bagels! Panera makes the best chocolate chip cookies and the bear claw is delicious too. The Cheese and Jalapeno bagels are the best. If you asking for a to go bagel, make sure to ask them for knife to spread the cream cheese, because they sometimes forget. 

I enjoyed the soup bread bowl, the bread had a nice crunch to and it was fresh. The chili had a good flavour to it. However the bread to chili ratio wasn't good. There was too much bread, and not enough chili. The sandwhiches are decent. I had the Cuban sandwhich is was okay, but probably not something I would order again.

I use it for other salads that i make at home. He told me to hold on while he asked his boss then while i was waiting for him he took a phone order and again he says that was more than enough and that they were on a low supplyof lemon vinaigrette. Like seriously dude im trying to purchase it i am not asking for it for free.

I have been going there for about a year on a regular basis bringing clients as well as my family at least once a week. Every single person has commented on the lousy, slow service. Today we got off the plane from a family vacation and went to Tony's  before going home. We were seated and no one came near us for more than 15 minutes. So we got up and left. The hostess saw us leaving, as well as the several servers standing around talking, and the hostess put her head down and walked away quickly. When I got out to the car I called and asked for the manager. The person that answered said he could help. I told him what happened and he apologized and offered a gift card. I declined it because even if the meal was free the service is so bad it isn't worth ever going back.

1,"I love this place. Whenever me and my boyfriend go they have karaoke, which is entertaining. We've tried all their curries and while they are all really good, we decided last night that the yellow curry with vegetables is our favorite. We usually get around a 3 on the spicy level just because I feel like the spicier it is the more it takes away from the actual flavor. And this place is definitely full of flavor when it comes to their curry and noodles. The drunken noodles are definitely my go to. I went about a month ago and they had run out of the drunken noodles which I was bummed about, but I can't blame them because they are amazing! I ended up getting the pad Thai and it was almost equally as good. The only thing I wouldn't recommend on the menu was the fresh spring rolls. The peanut sauce it came with was good but the overall roll lacked flavor and tasted like lettuce. We decided we should have just gotten the fried spring rolls. Maybe next time!

We decided to leave the restaurant and cancel the order, but they charged us for the dumplings anyway and didn't even put in the effort to give us our change back. I don't know if this was on purpose or not, but whoever was working around 6-8PM on a Tuesday night really made our experience at that restaurant awful.

Now to the food:
My favorite appetizer is the signature salad with goat cheese (a lot of it!) and caramelized pecans (so delish!!!)
My fav entre is either the braised short ribs with the mash or the turkey burger with the mango chutney. They're both so well-seasoned. My mouth is watering just typing this. 
My fave dessert is hands-down the carrot cake. In fact, I ordered a whole cake for my grand opening and all my guests were hooked!
My fav drink is the pomegranate iced tea (I dont drink alchy but they have an amazing bar menu too!)

overall its an amazing restaurant with an amazing vibe and an even amazing menu!

0,"I purchased a groupon which was $40 for food for four people, I think I paid around $25 for it but don't remember exactly and that particular deal is no longer available on the site. Anyway, I've been to other Indian restaurants purchasing a voucher for food for four people and only bringing one other person and it was never an issue. This time after ordering the food, the guy tells me he won't accept the voucher because 4 people aren't there. On the spot,  I had to buy the $12 for $20 deal for 2 in which each person only saves a measly $4. I wouldn't have gone if I had known beforehand. The waiter would not give 2 separate bills with $10 taken off each bill but said the whole $20 must only be taken off one person's bill. He had no customer service skills and couldn't care less about the quality of a customers dining experience.

0,"I think this restaurant is overpriced and the food I had was ok.
I ordered the Ceviche de pescado and Anticucho. The ceviche is big enough to share and they should probably have a smaller (less expensive) version on the menu. The meat portion of the Anticucho was just right, but the salad was not really necessary.

The flavours on the Ceviche were pretty good. It was well cooked, and the corn was really good. The leche de tigre was flavourful too. 

I was a little dissapointed with the Anticucho and expected a stronger marinade flavour.

I also had the Chicha Morada which tasted like it was made with Maiz Morado, but was too watered down and was missing some of the fruit flavours that come along with Chicha. I noticed they don't sell Inca-Kola by the can, just bottle.

The chips and cancha on the table instead of bread was really nice.

This is a nice restaurant but way overpriced for the food it serves. If they can get the portion sizes and prices down it'd be a good value. As is now, $50 for 1 person to have an appetizer and a main course is just too much.",1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0,"I visited for the lunch buffet today after reading the good reviews on Yelp to satisfy my Indian craving. I eat Indian food alot and frequent lunch buffets. This was easily the absolute worst I've ever been to. 
Maybe I went on an off day because these other reviews are positive, or maybe I'm just used to spicier/more flavorful foods in other areas (I live near DC), but these dishes had absolutely no taste whatsoever. NOTHING had any spice and everything seemed watered down. Also, we showed up at the buffet 15 minutes after it opened, and dishes were cold!! That is unacceptable. 
The vegetarian options were edible (though severely lacking flavor). However, the chicken curry option had an extremely off taste, and was actually repulsive to the point of having to spit it out. The curried meatballs were clearly mealy, out-of-a-package frozen variety, and the tandoori chicken was straight up cold. 
It was nice that the buffet included drinks (mango lassi and chai), however it hardly made up for the food.

Note: I do want to mention that one woman dining had ordered chicken tikka masala (I'm guessing) instead of having the buffet, which looked and smelled really good.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1,"I visited this little restaurant with my best friend on our way out of Las Vegas on my birthday weekend. 

We were greeted and seated promptly. The menu had some super appealing items on it, so it was hard to choose. The service was good although I felt like we were mis-heard on a few occasions, and it's not as though it's terribly loud in there. (I asked for water and said it three times, but he brought me coffee AND orange juice? Not sure how water sounds like coffee or orange juice.) 

The decor was modern and cool, as was the staff.

After a lot of inner turmoil, I decided on the two eggs any style with chive potatoes and toast. The potatoes were awesome. The toast was soft and thick, which was nice. My friend had deviled eggs, if I'm not mistaken. She was happy with hers. We shared a large pancake, which both of us thought was just OK--nothing special. But it looked so fluffy!

I think that overall it is worth the price and the experience. The food quality is great, as is the atmosphere.

If you're in the playoffs of your fantasy league you don't sit on the couch, you get off your ass and find that $@%in dog!  (do you know the movie?) 

I walked in to a  comfy cozy, Christmas light-lit bar. I knew I'd be ordering the Samuel Smith's Taddy Porter, gracias Ken M. once more for the great review.  What made tonight great, were the happy hour specials.  They had two for one beers, ALL BEERS.  So my Taddy Porter was $2.50 a bottle, insanity.  Since my girlfriend doesn't drink, I had to have two at the same time, it wouldn't have been right to order one...quit judging.  

Appetizers were also discounted, so after a round of scrumptiously priced buffalo chicken fingers and the beers, I couldn't have been happier.  

Oh, and they had some promotion going on where a guy on a mic was giving stuff away at halftime.  It sounded fun, but I was too invested in my libations to pay much attention.

Both beers had great taste to them and had perfect pours.  We were actually late to the airport cause we wanted to stay.  We also ordered a pizza to hold us through our flight.

Atmosphere was great, a lot of people having a good time.  Outside area is nice and spacious.  They even have some corn hole sets that you can play with.

Lots of noise, loud music, almost too dark to read the menu.  The lady at the counter rolled her eyes when I asked if the veggie burger had wheat in it, and she just stated flatly, ""Nothing in here is certified gluten free.""  That was that.  

In this day and age, it's not an uncommon request to have a gluten free option, and for all I know the veggie burger could be gluten free, but the girl behind the counter terminated that conversation by turning around and walking away from me, so I didn't ever find out and didn't get to eat at all.

My son's burger was pretty small, which is not a bad thing unless you are a teenager (he is), and he ordered Urban fries but got regular ones.  He was not terribly impressed with the burger itself, but ate it just the same.

The exterior of the building is very interesting and inviting. Upon entry I was immediately greeted and seated. I am not a huge fan of barbecue but was interested in their brisket salad which was what I ultimately ordered. I have to say it was fantastic. The brisket comes in slices rather than shredded, which is not my favorite way, but it was well cooked and seasoned so I didn't mind. The salad components were fresh and plentiful. I really enjoy their Carolina Barbecue Sauce combined with blue cheese dressing made in house. My companion had pulled pork sandwich with green bean casserole and mac and cheese. Both were quite tasty as well as the sandwich.

Service was friendly almost to the point of being annoying because she kept checking back to us at the table while we were trying to catch up on conversation. However all of our needs were met efficiently so I have no complaints.

1,"I was super bummed to see that Cheerful House had closed, but Saino quietly opened in their space and their tasty food and attentive service make them a favorable replacement. Lunch is a super-cheap $10/pp for a selection of about 5 vegetarian and 5 carnivorous entree options, two choices of rice, and a fresh bar of vegetables and condiments. 

Selection may be a bit small compared to other spots in town, but these guys do everything well- the goat curry was easily the most meaty version I've found even including a la carte ordering, their raita was uniquely flavorful with fresh herbs, and naan was made fresh for the table. I'm an omnivore, but the palak paneer and gobi aloo are the stuff vegan dreams are made of! I wish they'd add to their appetizer/dessert items- I only found a single samosa and a tiny cup of rice pudding, and was sad not to be able to end my meal with gulab jamun. 

Saino is definitely worth a visit. Signage and decor indicate that they provide Himalayan and Nepalese cuisine but their current offerings seem to be mostly Indian cuisine.

The interior is cute. Set up where you can sit and enjoy your lunch but after work you can post up at the bar and sip on something yummy. I wish I had the chance to try one of their margs but alas, I had work to get done at my job.
I got the AZ Style burrito meal and also a chicken taco. The chicken taco was free because I checked in on Foursquare. Love Foursquare deals.
The tortilla was amazing, super soft and chewy and not hard/stale or thin/transparent. The potatoes were thick cube cut and the pollo was seasoned with something not too spicy. I should have asked for it without onions, they were tiny but I'm not a fan in general.
They have an array of salsas to choose from, but the bottles weren't labeled so I was a little hesitant on what I was getting myself into so I stayed clear.

The cocktails were terrific then but one I had really wanted to try they didn't have the components for at the time. I thought I'd give them another chance and bring someone whose birthday it was as well after I had raved about how great their cocktails were from before. This time literally half (and I actually mean 50%) of their drink menu could not be made because they were missing components to make it.  How can you function without being able to make half of your advertised drinks?  The manager said to mention this next time I was there but didn't offer to do anything while I was there now. So that of course means he has no intention of doing anything at the next time either as he also purposely didn't offer his name either.

So, I give her one of the stars because she had personality and a good smile.

As we were waiting there was one person who was waiting for her order.  As we stood there waiting; we watched what was going on in the kitchen.  They were giving out wrong orders at the drive thru and had to redo things.  Buzzers were going off and not answered.  Anyhow, we got our order before the girl who was before us.

1,"I wish I could give this place a full 5 stars and this place does deserve all stars because the sandwiches are bloody delicious and the service is quick and friendly.

I came here with a lot of high hopes and this place lived up to it.I ordered a Pho Beef Banh Mi sandwich which was so so so tasty.The bun is perfect and fresh so is the meat and the tops.I love the sauce used on it.But what got me a little thinking was this sandwich with tax is close to $9.I mean it's an expensive sandwich and definitely not too big.

Secondly I feel they need to add a kids menu on their menu I mean I don't want to spent $12/13 on a meal for a kid without a drink.They should introduce small sandwiches or maybe half sandwiches as a part of the kids menu.

Overall I loved what I ordered and I do look forward to coming here many times and trying their different signature sandwiches and poutine and sides.

I would love to congratulate the owner for brining this amazing concept in Oakville and kudos to the team for delivering such fresh and divine sandwiches.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 2 2 3 3 1 1 3 2 3 2 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 1 1 2 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 3 2 2 2 1 2 2 3 3 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0

The minute I put my feet into the store to take  a look around I was bombarded but two employees asking me what can I get for you, what would you like. Although friendly I don't think I made it passed the door mat and already I felt like I was on a timer. never got a chance to properly look at the items so I quickly looked around while two guys gawked at me waiting to make my first move. So I nervously said the lemon pepper chicken breast, and a brisket sandwich. 

Total for 4 pieces of chicken breast and a sandwich came to 40 bucks and I just rushed out of there the same way I was rushed to place my orders. I was the only customer in the store!!! 

I saw items on the shelves, and in the fridges near by but never really looked around.

1,"I work downtown, near the capitol, so when a coworker suggested we try Mel's Diner for lunch one day, I was game.  I had passed the place many times, but had no idea it was *the* Mel's Diner made famous from the hit show ""Alice."" 

Being a photographer, I was more interested in visiting for the photo-op than the food  so I knew I just had to bring along my camera and get some shots of this landmark...(http://www.flickr.com/photos/mimiahmedphotography/sets/72157623318556037/).  After reading some of the reviews, I wasn't expecting much food wise.  Low and behold I was pleasantly surprised.  I thought I'd keep it simple, so I ordered a bacon cheeseburger.  I was pleased with my meal which arrived in a decent amount of time and was cooked as I had requested-- well done but still juicy.  I had cole slaw as a side which was simple but tasty.  Not bad for a lunch under $10.

The staff was friendly and even the infamous ""Foul-mouthed Frank"" chatted it up with us for a bit and showed off some news clippings he'd saved from articles featuring him in the New Times and others.

Overall, I enjoyed Mel's Diner and have been back since.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1,"I'd always wanted to dine at a BLT restaurant in NYC and never made it, so having the opportunity here was perfect. You wind your way through the Casino at Bally's to get to this gem.

The whole experience was really excellent. From the friendly hostess, waitress, circulators and even the management- we were well cared for and just had super service. 

Ok, food! 
We had the French onion soup, wonderful and cheesy.
I ordered the 6oz Waygu Beef Filet Mignon, and it was quite possibly the best steak I've ever had. The extra money for the Waygu was worth every penny. I had the green beans as a side and they were delish.
My companion had the monkfish wrapped in bacon with broccolini and bow tie pasta, which was also very good. 
We were very happy with our portion sizes. 
Now, the popovers! What a fabulous bread service to offer. They were out of this world. As a bread baker I was tickled. Popovers have been my only failure. BLTSteak provides the recipe and I cannot wait to give it another shot. 

Hard decision, but we passed on dessert.

I'm not sure what has happened, but its just not the same quality food or atmosphere. We did go later in the evening, about an hour before they closed, but this shouldn't excuse the poor presentation of trays and food basically scattered all over them or the fact it seemed as if there were only two or three employees arounds besides the servers. I could have gotten over this if it weren't for the crepe station. I love going to the Creperie they have across from the buffet, and since they offer the same crepes in the buffet you'd assume they would be the same quality. You'd be wrong. I understand that they need to get crepes out quickly, but making them so quickly that the cheese in a ham and cheese crepe does not have time to melt? Not really worth waiting 15 minutes for it.

1,"I've been to the original Vig and although I was a fan of the patio I was not a fan of the service. The service here was a bit better. I loved the vibe of this place and the Arizona room was pretty cool. The area next to the fireplace looks like a great place to hang out and have drinks. 

The portions here pretty big, but I ordered the horseradish crusted tilapia and the serving was just right. It came with a quarter of a stuffed mushroom, which was different, but good. The roasted red pepper sauce that accompanied the fish was a great compliment. And the potatoes were yummy too. Everyone else had sandwiches, which were huge and enough for lunch the next day. The crabmeat and artichoke dip was also tasty. 

I loved the atmosphere of this place much more than the Arcadia location and although this place is a little further form home and you have to valet, this is the one I will return to.

I went in and was at first surprised by how simple the menu was. I ordered a chicken panini and I got it all wrapped up and it was hot I was excited about my meal. I took it home and unwrapped it to find 4 or 5 chicken strips with a little (and I mean little) sauce, on what looked and tasted like Texas toast from the Teeter. That was it. If you want a sandwich  you are better off giving a 10 year old some cheap ingredients, a George Foreman, and telling them to use their imagination.  And I paid 8 bucks for this sandwich. Never again. They give a bad name to delis. 

I was going to give this place two stars because the people behind the counter were so friendly, but while thinking back on the food I just couldn't bring myself to give my fellow yelpers even a glimmer of what would be false hope.

1,"I've been wanting to try this place for a long time. I must say it met all of my expectations.

The place is small and has a lot of charm. The people who work here are very friendly. They will gladly explain what's on the menu for you. This is nice because most of the food has a lot ingredients mostly common in Peru, like yuca and sweet plantain, which are delicious by the way. 

I ordered an A lo Pobre burger, the best translation for it I think is poor man's burger. It is not poor at all, let me tell you. It is decent size and very delicious! The special sauce that comes as a side with the burger was finger-licking good. 

For dessert I had an alfajor, which kinda looks like a macaroon but less puffy and flat and is filled with dulce de leche. It was really good. 

They carry Inca Kola. This is Peru's most popular soda. It really adds to the authenticity of the place. If you like Mountain Dew, you're going to like Inca Kola.

1,"I've had the pleasure of enjoying a delicious meal at the Roaring Fork in Austin and this one, conveniently located across from my Hotel (Firesky) is just as good.

Our party of 8 started with lots of apps. Everyone was super psyched to try the green chili, but I just found it so-so.  However, the mac and cheese was unbelievable. Unfortunately, I don't think many other people at the table got to it because I devoured most of it. Oops.  Their guac totally hit the spot too.

I was pretty full after the apps, but still had some fish tacos coming my way.  Three generous sized flour tacos filled with fish, veggies and rice. I found more room in my tummy for these! 

It turned out I needed to find additional room in my stomach because the manager was sweet enough to send out a few comp desserts for our table. You can't go wrong with any of their desserts, but the pineapple cake (apparently a favorite of the Manager's wife) was the best.

They have an incredible selection of wines to choose from and you can walk around the whole place looking at what they have. There's lots of comfortable seating and tables, but I like to go to the tasting bar to sit. 

I love to nibble on stuff when I drink wine and they have plenty of that here. Plus their wine flights make it really easy to try out different types of wine and not spend a lot of money buying bottles you might not like. I've tried several different types of wines I've never had before because they had flights to try them out. The service here is great and they are very knowledgeable about the wines. Even if you know nothing about wines, you can tell them what you like (e.g., fruity and sweet) and they can pick out some good wines to match what that. I went here years ago with some friends and did just that (when I knew nothing about wines).

1,"In regards to accuracy of information provided by other reviews, the photo of the self serve kiosk is not from 20 Eglinton E and Yonge. Second, 20 Eglinton E is not a drive thru location as reported in another review.

Let me be the first one to actually write a review for the 20 Eglinton E location. I have been to this location for many years. I have never had a complaint about the food quality and customer service. I don't recall them screwing up my order. The only issue I have is I wish the management would be more aggressive dealing with the students who don't order anything or make a huge mess and hang around taking up limited seating.

McDonalds is now offering an all day breakfast menu. I took up their offer and wanted to see how fast they can serve me a Sauage 'N Egg McMuffin. From the time my order was placed, it took 4 minutes and 30 seconds to get my order. That's pretty fast on a Sunday at 5:30pm. It tasted pretty good.

1,"Introduced to this place by our good friends David and Shondra. The place is very small and even their covered patio wasn't much bigger but where small in size, this place is huge on flavor. It was Saturday night, before six p.m. and there was an hour wait for a table because of reservations. We managed to get a seat at the 'bar' which is a small counter on the patio where there is side by side seating. The food we ordered was awesome and they had a very nice selection of imported beer. I love Singha, the more commonly available Thai beer, but I tried the Lucky Buddha beer from China, which comes in a nice Buddha shaped bottle. It was actually good beer but since I am not a frequent beer drinker, it might have been more to my taste than to others. In any event, I can hardly wait to go back again and try some of the other dishes on the menu. I will make a reservation well in advance this time.

The only reason I gave less than five stars is the wait time for a rez but solve that my making one next time.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 1 1 2 3 0 0 0 0 1 3 3 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1,"Let me state upfront that I rarely do steakhouses, especially chain steakhouses; however, due to a $30 gift card and a steak loving 19-year-old daughter, I opted to make an exception for our Friday lunch date. Boy am I glad I did, as the two sirloin steaks that we ordered where the most tender, leanest sirloins I've ever eaten. I should also add that, as a former butcher, I am very finicky when it comes to beef.

My daughter went with a 6 oz with a side of mac and cheese, which was excellent in itself. It ran about $10.99. I chose the 8 oz with a side of broccoli (perfectly steamed) for $13.99. The steaks were expertly seasoned and accurately cooked. A mini-loaf was also served with butter. Service was friendly and casual but not real attentive, in fact, I ordered a fountain drink that I never received.
The dining room had a great atmosphere with  comfortable booths and the sanitation grade was a 97.

At around 35 bucks with tip, it was definitely an expensive splurge, but the lean steaks and  happy daughter, made it all worthwhile. I'm shocked, but the 4 stars for this trip are legit.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 0 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 2 0 2 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1

Love the menu and selections. If everything were 20% more expensive, I'd be less impressed. Let's just say, its damn good for the money. Yer not gonna get a better burger for less that $7 anywhere. We've since moved to over half hour away, but we make the trip for the cajun fries, the housemade parmesan peppercorn dressing and the Bohdi. Bohdi rocks!

The staff is very friendly and welcoming. I have noticed many have been with them since opening 3-4 years ago. If you get a chance, belly up to the bar. All the handles are impressive and they're quick to give you a sample of whatever catches your eye. I've met some interesting folks here. Its ClevelandAkronCanton, so ya gotta make the first move and open up first, but thats how ya meet great souls in this area. Be sure to try the ""nanobrew"" Mad Cap. Great story, great local folks.

I have eaten here previously and had an an enjoyable experience, but today my wife and I went to this location for lunch and I have never had such  appaling service. We were told to sit at the sushi bar and asked for a table because I am in a walking boot and the sushi bar was an uncomfortable fit. One server told us to sit and wait for the table. Another then asked if he could help us, and when we explained we were waiting for a table he went to confirm with the first server. Then a third server (I assume she was their boss by the way she sopke to them) told my wife there was no table for us and ""You sit here!"" In a loud commanding tone pointing to the sushi bar. My wife and I were absolutely stunned at her rudeness payed for the 2 plates we ate, and left.

1,"My buddy said that he noticed this place the other day and he suggested it so we thought we'd give it a try. We are foodies, we love food. We entered, and immediately noticed no one was present, not one customer, nor worker. We began to look at the menu when the cooks came out of the back. We both ordered a double bacon cheeseburger with ""healthy fries"" (which are actually fries topped with bacon and mozzarella and I loved this) and a custard shake. The order is followed by them cooking it in front of you and you picking your toppings (much like a subway). The variety of toppings was mind-bottling. We proceeded to a corner table and admired the very modern and tasteful atmosphere. We then proceeded to take pictures of our food and then devoured them. Holy sweet mother of god, this burger was the tits, and that's pretty bomb. As we stuffed our faces, customers began to come in slowly, but never enough to look like a bustling casual restaurant.

1,"My daughter and I went there on Saturday night.  The place wasn't very busy, only one other table taken.  We sat down and were immediately greeted by the waitress.  She was very helpful, explained the menu to me, and was also very patient as I had never had Indian food before.  My daughter and I both got a chicken dish, Chicken Tikki Masala and Tandoori Chicken  Megan's was a boneless chicken and mine had bones in.  Both were pretty spicy, which surprised me, didn't really expect that, but what did I know, it was all new to me.  They were both very good, and I did enjoy them.  We also got rice and naan, which was ok, and she brought us out some sauces, the best being the Mint Chutney.  That one little sauce was my favorite thing out of the whole meal.  I would spread it on toast and eat it if I could!  

All in all, I really enjoyed this place.  If we are in the neighborhood I would definitely drop in again, not only for the food, but for the fantastic service.

0,"My family and I decided to try this place because we'd never been before. I understand why it is expensive because of the cuts of meat and some of the other ingredients. The overall experience was okay. The service was mediocre. I did like that you each get your own individual pot with your preferred broth. We tried a lot of different things. I'd say my favorite parts to put in the soup base were the homemade noodles (which I recommend cooking for awhile in the broth), enoki mushrooms, thinly sliced beef, and the napa cabbage. Also, get the hoisin sauce and put a little on your noodles when you pull them out of the broth. I'm not sure I'll come back here, but it was an interesting experience. I also think that I've had better hot pot, but if you're really craving it and can't get to Chicago then this place is ok. Just pay attention to what you're ordering if you're concerned about price and pay attention to what your friends are ordering, some ingredients are shareable like the enoki mushrooms, the sliced meats, potatoes, napa cabbage, noodles.

Overall the food has been pretty good but the restaurant/service hasn't been anything worth mention. We went this past Sunday for brunch, were seated, orders taken, then we were forgotten. We waited for an hour. Our waitress did not ask to refill drinks, check in to see if we needed anything nor did she stop by to let us know that the kitchen was backed up or offer any explanation as to the excessive wait. We saw a family that was seated after us and served leave the restaurant, so we did as well and went to Panera across the street to eat as we were starving by that point. 

We don't expect a lot from a chain restaurant, but this was unacceptable and we will not be returning or recommending. For the amount of our time that was wasted, we could have gone to Tremont for Johnny Mangos or Barrio's brunch (and paid the same price for better food); next time we will.

Reading other reviews about the taste and quality of this restaurant were very over rated. We both had the three course meal; very pricey for what is  served ($45) and the sirloin was chewy and too peppery; the cut was not right. The wine selection was fair at best; too overpriced for the selection that was presented. The first bottle we had was too green and chemical tasting. The second bottle was better but not worth $45. The ambiance is fair, but the music needs to change. The music did not match the attire for the place which was odd. Odd enough, our waitress was wearing jeans and so were a few others. Again, the staff attire did not match the ambiance of the place. Parking is not free ($2), but for how much we paid ($145, not including tip), it should be free.

We started with cocktails. I had the New Old Fashioned which was delicious.  The liquor was infused with vanilla bean and fig and topped with citrus bitters.  So good.  My friend had a margarita that has chili pepper infusion.  She liked her drink too.

We shared the cheese tray, which was excellent.  A nice variety of cheeses, toasty bread, nuts, and grapes.  More than ample portion for two.

We both decided on the short ribs on a bed of white cheese grits.  SO GOOD!  Meat was fall off the bone tender and seasoned to perfection.  Will definitely order this again.

When we arrived we were given the choice of inside or outside seating.  As much as we hated to pass up the beautiful outdoor seating area, it was really hot so we opted for inside.  Go glad we did because we were able to linger over our drinks and dinner while staying completely comfortable.

Our waiter was delighted and provided excellent service.

This place is down right scummy! Don't eat here is you value your life. The wiatress no longer works there and good for her. She was smart enough to get out of this dump. This owner Chad is a jerk. So arrogant and sits around on his stupid phone while others are working. I really don't blame the wait staff. The apple bakes are suppose to be the best around. Sure if you like your food to put you in a diabetic coma. There was so much sugar, I am surprise it didn't give be diabetes right then. I had to ask for an egg over easy just to try to eat something good. After waiting for 30 minutes for one egg, wow. $2.25 for 1 egg. It's an egg with nothing in it or on it.

1,"On the road with a laptop, I was searching for a place to plunk down and scoop up some free wi-fi.  Unfortunately, it took me a while to find this place.  If I had found it sooner, I might have gotten more work done!
Once you find an open outlet (from the nest of extension cords by the windows) and hunker down over some good joe, you'll find the wi-fi quick enough, and the atmosphere pleasant enough to attend to any tasks that you may need to. 

The breakfast sandwich here is a force to be reckoned with- eggs and bacon on a beautifully made croissant (flaky and authentic!) with cheese, it was healthy enough sized to feed two.  Or me.

And if you stay here long enough into the evening, they transition gracefully into an indie music venue.  The beer taps start flowing at 4PM, and when I was there it was open mic night, which a mix of slam poetry, talented musicians, and a few kooks thrown into the mix.

All in all, I have to say this place is a credit to Downtown, and adds a dimension of reality to the surreal place that is Fremont St.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 2 3 2 1 0 2 3 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 2 2 0 0 0 3 2 2 3 3 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 2 2 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1
1,"One of the reasons we stayed at the Grand was for the pool deck.  It has to be one of the best pools in downtown Vegas.  Please note that cabana minimums changed based on day of the week, etc.  It is worthwhile to get a cabana because you get a place to hang that is comfy.

They serve food on the deck along with drinks.  Service was a little slow so that dropped the stars to four vs. five.  We were able to meet some folks from WI and IL so it was fun to meet some other folks.

They have refreshing water out there as well because it gets really hot on the deck.  The pool is your savior so dip in and then get out back into the sun.  If you are staying at the hotel you don't need to bring your towels.  Also, they have DJ's spinning and live music at night so this place is jumping!

Also, there are coupons for the deck if you are staying there.  For us, we had such a nice stay that next time we will only stay at the Grand.

0,"Ordered delivery for sweet and sour spare rib, chicken fried rice, and egg soup. The call taker was friendly and helpful. However, the order took more than 50 mins to be delivered...when I live in the vicinity of 5 min drive. I thought an accident took a toll on the time so when I asked the delivery man, I got a very rude and curt 'we're busy'. Shocked from uncalled hostility, I handed a bill and waited my change so that I could tip. Instead he short hands me by keeping a meager change, and authoritatively (and retorically) asks 'it's okay right?'. 

Inside the package, no tissue, fork, spoon, no utensil whatsoever to eat the food with. However, there were two soy sauce packs, two fortune cookies, and the food was descent for the price. 

Unfortunately, I will never order from this location again with its poor delivery experience that made me feel extremely guilty about asking why their food was delivered late, not to mention withholding from proper exchanges of money.

A lousy rainy saturday had us looking for a new place to have a late lunch. 
We ordered the potato skins app. And tho it took a little too long to get to the table it was worth the wait. We were enjoying the ambiance and decor of this great old building. The skins were perfect. Gouda cheese with nice crisp bacon and chives. So delicious!  We like to order so that we can share with each other. My husband loves potato pancakes so he got the PP Reuben. The Pot. Cakes were bland but a little S&P fixed that up. Tender corned beef and the slaw was a perfect side.  I chose the Bavarian Club. Never before tasted braunsweiger. It was so delicious I didn't want to share...but I did.  I had to try the sauerkraut for a side. And it was fantastic with chunks of pork mixed in! 
I can't believe we managed to eat everything even the potato skins. But it was all so delicious we couldn't stop.

0,"Overall this place is the definition of ""Just okay"". The food is actually pretty cheap and on the whole is not that bad, toss in free popcorn and there are worse places to eat when you want bar food. The wings are my favorite thing to get but they are only good (I.e. Not dry and overcooked) about half of the time so it's a toss up whether or not you will enjoy them.

The real draw back is the service. The waitresses are uninterested at best and downright rude at worst. They always seem like it is an inconvenience that you are there. One time a waitress just stared at us with a scowl on her face from the other room because we had sat down at a table with a group of friends on a Saturday night (at like midnight) and so she couldn't leave as long as someone was sitting at a table. We weren't there to eat, the kitchen was closed, and we found out that she didn't have to stay at all after all so she was rude to us for no reason.

1,"Pretty stoked on this place. First time here and the nigiri and sashimi was very fresh. My mom just moved here from Japan (where I grew up) and I've had a really hard time finding a sushi spot that impresses her. We were both really happy tonight. Not only were the pieces really fresh but they were nice and thick as well. Looking forward to coming back. If the quality is always this good then I'd have to say that this is one of the better sushi places in town. 

Update: Went back exactly one week later and ordered the same sashimi platter and the cuts were not as fresh and were not nearly as thick. It was still fresh but with the cuts being smaller, it's going to be hard spending the money on the sashimi platter again. Also the nigiri was smaller as well. I'll give it another try. They had two chefs there and I'm not sure if we had one the first week and then the other the second. Notice the slits in the nigiri in my pictures. The nigiri didn't have those the second time we went. Hmmmm.

0,"Previously I've had great experiences here. Great food, good drinks, fun atmosphere and, let's be honest, every adult, if given the opportunity will play on a see-saw. With that said, the service is AWFUL. Having a collective of bartenders, service staff, and management treat us with a complete lack of respect is inexcusable.  

We had made reservations a week in advance only to find out on the day of that there was no record of it. We thought we had fixed the issue with, Julie, the ""manager"" however when people started to arrive they were told it was last call.  Apparently, Julie hadn't fixed the problem at all and the 40 of us were left without a venue. Our savvy party planner to the rescue could fix this, yes? I mean, what bar in their right mind throws out 40 people on a freaking Tuesday? Park on Fremont, that's who. After Julie kicked out said party planner 30 seconds later and the place was empty. However, the bar across the street was more than accommodating. 

I only hope the owners can see that Julie is bad for their business.

0,"Pros:
The beers were delicious. One can never go wrong with Great Lakes beer, especially straight from tap. 
The food here is slightly over priced, but is expected from an airport restaurant. I do have to say that the basket of fries came in an enormous portion that one person cannot finish by themselves. It was perfectly cooked, crispy and fresh. (Who review's fries? I had to mention it because it was indeed satisfying with my beer.)

Cons:
The service was subpar. I sat on the bar. The female bartender seemed like I was just an inconvenience, and I had to flag her down whenever I needed something instead of simply asking if everything was okay. I got a cold vibe from her every time I asked a question, like I walked into her house and disrespected her in some way. She kept hanging out near the kitchen entrance chatting and joking happily with her co-workers every time she finished serving someone, but didn't even try to make eye contact when talking to me, like she was too busy to help. 

Conclusion:
If the service wasn't so dull and cold, I would have given it 4-stars for the delicious beer.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1,"Pros: 
Love the charm. Lots of stuff to do without being a hassle. To compare it to The Yard which is similar in concept, there's much more to do and it's much easier to gain access to it. Foosball, boxing ring, hula hoops, dancing, bean bags. It's like the party I would want to host myself.

Atmosphere is charming; they were playing 90s pop and hip-hop, fun classic group dancing songs, the lighting was nice.

A food menu! I love to snack while out. I'll have to try their brunch menu too.

Giant mason jar drinks were very refreshing. I can't speak to the strength as I was sweating so much-- which leads me to...

Cons:
It was SO HOT. I learned about the no A/C deal the hard way.I drank quite a bit, but felt nothing at the end of the night, probably because I was sweating it all out.

Tight parking-- I don't mind valet parking but I understand some people prefer not. It is not very well lit around the block, either, so finding nearby parking may be a bit risky.

Couple of weeks ago, I took my sister and brother-in-law to go eat at Beckett's Table, from hearing such good reviews about them. We happened to walk in with out a reservation and they were able to sit us right away which was amazing and I was getting a really good vibe from the place. Anyways ""long story short"" our designated server was never really there for us. It was the hostess and the manager filling our drinks when needed to be filled. Plus they had someone else bring us our food as well. Our waitress only showed up to take our orders and to give us our bill. Besides she gave my sister a nasty stare for wanting to order off the kids menu from not being so hungry. I leave this poor review for that reason.

I also think the price range for the food is a bit high for the amount they serve. But still food was amazing.

Can only imagine a couple scenarios, we went on an off day, or most of these reviews are good because they've never had authentic food. 

As a frequent visitor of the Caribbean, including Trinidad and Tobago, I thought I'd try the roti here. The roti was way too thick, appeared to have no ground up chickpea in it, and overall was just unpleasant. This went for both the chicken and the shrimp variants.

The pholourie here was nothing like the pholourie I've had before. It was dripping with oil, and incredibly soggy. Even the dough it was made from was very different.

No big surprise with the patties here, they are the frozen and reheated ones that I've found everywhere else in the valley, yet somehow this one was inedible, as if it was freezer burned. 

I hope this review will make people think twice about blindly going here, if you know what's good, then this place will disappoint.

1,"Really disappointed in this place. I've been going here off and on for a few years and I feel that it's went way downhill. The bartenders used to be really great and the bartenders in there now are terrible. They make terrible drinks, if you drink mixed drinks and I find the bartenders incredibly rude at times.
Many people go in there to sing karaoke and when there is a big line-up to sing, the karaoke guy always tends to keep himself inserted in the line-up. Personally, the karaoke guy should remove himself if there are more then 5-7 people already singing. Karaoke is for the customers and not for the karaoke host.
As far as the food, the food is actually pretty good.
I'm just disappointed in this place, considering how it used to be years ago. Hopefully they'll change some things and get it back to where it used to be. 

UPDATE...... I'm updating my review from a three star to a four star review. They added fresh booths in Marcels and they changed all of the bartenders and servers. Well done!!!! The service is incredibly better. The changes are very nice to see. Great job!!!

1,"Really loved the feel of this restaurant, it was sort of steampunk without being too kitschy. Our server was great and very knowledgeable about the food and drinks offered. My husband got a beer and I chose their version of a margarita, both of which were very good. For food we ended up splitting the Fondue for Two and the Peking Duck Lettuce wraps. 

The fondue came out first, and I'm not really sure what they gave us, but it had more in common with salt water taffy than melted cheese. Once we let our server know she profusely apologized and took it back to the kitchen. The manager came out and also apologized, and gave us several tasters of beer to try while we waited. The second time the fondue came out it was the proper texture, though honestly still not something to write home about (I believe it was recently taken off the menu in fact). The duck lettuce wraps, however, were far from disappointing. Perfectly cooked duck combined with the crunchy lettuce and orange sauce was an awesome combination.

Fondue flub aside, we would definitely come back here again and try some different food and drink combinations.",1 3 1 2 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 3 1 2 3 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1,"Richardson's was a staple for me when I lived in Phoenix plus it was walking distance for me. Beware if you plan on going after 6pm any night of the week you will be waiting for a table, but don't forget to check dick's hideaway right around the corner, same menu, different spot. All the drinks are great, the prickly pear marg is a must. The food is delicious. I have had everything on the menu and I swear for the garlic platter, the crusted Chilean sea bass (when they have it), The trio plate( pork tenderloin, fillet, and rack of lamb, the relleno platter, the rack of lamb. The burger is great, the chimayo chicken, in all reality you can order anything on the menu and it will be great. The only thing I have had that I wouldn't order again was the tamales but I make my own so I am biased. The atmosphere is dark and sexy. It is a nice comfy place, very small and packed but nice. The service is always good. They have great deals on wine before 4pm.

0,"Sadly, I was disappointed in this place because I had heard such good things about it. Maybe my hopes were too high but all I know is, I won't be going back. First thing and such a minor thing, the booths SUCK. You can feel the movement of the person behind you. And they're so bouncy you almost feel like your on a bouncy ball. Second thing, odd, BUT my kids ordered chocolate milk and they put so little chocolate that it may as well been plain white milk. When we got our order my boyfriends cheese enchilada was magically a chicken enchilada. He's worked in the industry so he let it slide. I got the chorizo and huevos combination and it was not good. They chorizo was vinegary and the cheese that was on the beans tasted so old it made the the entire table smell bad. The chips were stale and the tortillas I'm pretty sure are the mission tortillas you get at the grocery store. 
I'm from Texas and am pretty picky about my Mexican food but I can honestly say, this was just plain bad.
Wait staff was nice, attentive and the establishment itself is pleasant.",0 0 1 3 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1,"Seriously, Mama Ricotta's ""had me"" when they brought the bread to the table. I am in love with it. Soft, warm and it looks like they brush it w/ a little butter and herbs/garlic. Do I sound obsessed? Hope not...Anyway, a few dishes I have tried include:
Penne Alla Vodka
Lasagna
Both these pasta dishes are pretty good. I love them both but every once in a blue moon they can be a little off (dry, salty, etc)
Carrot Cake Cheesecake (for dessert I usually share and pick a bite or two and am over it, that's just me though. For my few bites, I liked it. It could have been a little more room temp, felt like it was pre sliced and taken out the fridge to our table but overall it was good. I liked the combo and it was huge--a must share dish. 

Love their sweet tea too!

Oh and the last time I went I had the BEST server. His name sounded like Lavender but I know it wasn't Lavender. He was friendly, patient and attentive--to the point that he was already filling my glass of sweet tea as soon as I finished my last sip.",0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 1 1 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 3 3 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0,"So I'll give them the fact that it's a Sunday morning and they seemed a bit understaffed in the kitchen (including the kitchen staff standing behind the building smoking) and their host was also waiting tables. I'll give them that. HOWEVER, I felt the need to share this experience regardless. It all started on a brisk Sunday morning, about 11:30. We were greeted by an annoyed girl and once she sat us down the first thing she said was ""I hate my job"" so it really set the mood right for this experience. We got our beverages and placed our order. About 45-50 minutes after we got our food (about a half hour of waiting she told us we were up next to get our food, then proceeded taking out 5ish other tables' food before ours finally came). Our food was so greasy and buttery that my eggs tasted like straight butter and my pancakes were not cooked all the way through. And now after eating I get home and feel sick to my stomach.

Overall, food was beyond greasy. Customer service was rough. Sunday date breakfast was ruined and I most likely will not be going to Denny's again.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 2 1 1 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0,"So disappointed today with Arcadia Farms Cafe. Met my friend today for brunch, I have been there many times for brunch. The service was, well actually, I don't really have a word for the service. Let me explain----after being seated at 10:30 we waited 10 minutes just for water. Another 10 minutes went by and I flagged down the host and asked if our server was around. She spoke to our server in passing, who rolled her eyes, pasted on a smile and took our order. Meanwhile, a couple with a young baby had sat down just adjacent to us, with the same server, and about 15 minutes later a 6 top of ladies sat on the other side of us. We did receive our food within a reasonable amount of time, thankfully. After 30 minutes the ladies still didn't have water, they went to the host and at that point decided to leave. I should state that the first server apparently was delegated to a different area, because we finished with a different server. The most disturbing part.....we left almost 2 hours later and the couple with the baby (remember them) HAD JUST RECEIVED THEIR FOOD!!!!!! Unacceptable service today!!!!!",0 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 2
0,"So grandpas I wanted to love even before arriving, but the experience was nothing to write home about.  First off let me say the decor and interior are what make this a potential for a better restaurant.  I enjoyed the fact that they went with not being a family oriented restaurant because sometimes you don't want to hear a crying baby while enjoying your meal, this place has a unique concept.

But the food!  How can you make the edges of a pizza crispy and the center absolutely soggy?  And the actual crust was bland at best, it's like the plainest most boring crust in town.  Also it seemed to take a little too long for something so subpar and there were only five other tables, two of which had already been served, actual wait time from ordering to 2 pizzas at table 27:40.

The service also was lacking a bit, it seemed our server wasn't interested in whether we had enough water, or extra napkins.  I actually got my water refilled by the hostess after another table had asked her because they like me were parched.

I won't try again but better luck to those of you who do.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 1 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1,"So me and my friends were in Vegas and getting broke so a bowl of pho sounded like a good decently priced meal. We get here at 9:30pm and its packed. We waited 5 minutes and were seated and I ordered my usual Pho Dac Biet, beef noodles with everything. Their broth was really good with not much oil which is surprising. The noodles were cooked perfectly, not too soft with a bit of bite left to them. The meat was also cooked well, the tai, raw meat, was really tender. The gan, tendon (my personal favorite), was also nice and soft. I wish they had culantro but at least they had limes, basil, jalepenos and bean sprouts which is a must. My friend got the Goi Cuon, the summer rolls, and they looked pretty good with the shrimp and pork. The cafe den da and sua da, iced coffee with sugar or milk, was definitely strong and kept me up which was the point. When I come to vegas again I definitely will come again and try their Banh Canh, thick rice starch noodles, with either the traditional shrimp and pork hocks or the thick orange soup with crab.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 3 3 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 2 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Now the second go around our server didn't explain the new menu nor did he know what an Arnold palmer was. He only explained that he was having a bad day since the Chargers lost. He seems lost and unsure of the menu. Then said we had the option to do the lunch or dinner menu. Stating lunch menu did not include appetizers and the dinner menu includes 4 appetizers each. We wanted to do lunch because we only wanted two appetizers. He said OK then a moment later came back and said we could only do the dinner option. He rarely check on us and looked high. 
Totally upset that we wasted $40 on broth that tasted bland and possibly old. The high light of our meal...my water. The appetizers were actually better then I expected. They were the 2nd highlight of our meal. Maybe we just got a bad server. Whatever the case. Not satisfied.

0,"So, about 10 of us showed up last night and I think we were ALL disappointed on so many levels; excruciatingly so. I'm amazed, considering how highly regarded this quaint restaurant is. I'm hoping it was just an 'off' night, although for not a single person at our table to be remotely satisfied speaks volumes in itself.

We were forced into a $40 Valentine's Day menu that did not satisfy anyone, let alone even make it to the table for some. Yes, that's right, two people from our group didn't even receive their (potentially mediocre) meals. 

To give you a better idea of this mediocrity: the appetizers were a joke; the seafood was painfully fishy and watery; the risotto was soupy and merely rice in a flavoured creamy-like substance; the vegan lasagna was an afterthought of random vegetables tossed in a tomato sauce; the meat looked like leather. Need I say more?

I'm really shocked, even service was lacking and we were the largest group there, forced to wait for prolonged periods of time to simply request anything.

All in all, I spent $50 on an unmemorable meal. At least the company and wine made up for its numerous shortcomings.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 1 2 1 1 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 1 1 1 3 0 1 0 3 2 0 2 0 1 0 2 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 2 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 3 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3

I would even make the drive just to get it when i lived far away. With memories of that curry chicken pho making my mouth water, i decided to go back again. I was a bit uneasy as I sat near enough to the kitchen to see that things here had changed. 

When i was near the kitchen before, i always caught glimpses of gleaming white floors and shiny aluminum... now, it looks dingy and disorganized. I tried to order my soup, and I'm not sure if they were out of the ingredients, or if it has been removed from the menu, but the result is the same. I didn't get any. 

The meal i did get was horrible. It was swimming in oil, the vegetables were old and tinged with brown, and the meat wasn't even edible.

I wonder what happened to the nice family that used to own the place.  It is so unlike the way it used to be that I can't even imagine that they are affiliated with it anymore.",1 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 2 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

0,"Still having opening pains?? Went here on a Sunday for the firs time, wasn't very busy. It is a very large place, very open and spacious on the inside, great patio on the outside. They have a few different tables outside to play games, open kitchen (you can see into kitchen) a few different bars, lots of tables and TV's spread throughout. It reminds me a lot of The Yard. The only reason I give the 2 stars is very poor service. I am not sure if our server was the only one working on Sunday or if it was an off day. He was polite and tried taking care of us, it just took a very long time to get drinks and refills. I also had higher hopes on the food, the food is meh...... not a very large menu, so not a lot to choose from. I ordered the wings, nothing really fantastic about them, they also weren't horrible. My girlfriend ordered one of their burgers, but only ate half of it. Decent beer selection, obviously its a brewery, good drink deals on the weekends. Not sure if this place is on my list to try again though.",0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0,"Summary: A roller coaster ride of review updates for this Robertos Taco location. 

I am not sure why it has to be this way, but it is (this way). This place is as consistent as I am religious in keeping to ""clean"" language in reviews (which is to say not at fucking all). 

You get a public service discount one day, you don't the next. 
You get a drink with your combo (they are listed as coming with one, and certainly implied in the term), and you don't. 

I'm wondering if they are as A or B with their hand-washing back there. (Every one working with food should be A-type personalities when it comes to sanitation.)

One year they are two stars; incrementally they make a fan out of a skeptic; then, they manage to fuck it all up again. 

The breakfast burritos are the shittiest I have purchased at any other location on planet Earth. Pro Tip: Don't buy them. Just get a lunch/dinner burrito really fucking early. Your stomach will suffer one way or another at 4 a.m..

0,"The only reason I keep going back to this location is because I am close. Every time I go in this location there is little to no food made, or what's out looks like it's been out for hours. The food when fresh is good, but it's never fresh unless you wait for them to make new. Today I went in at 4:30 and there was a manager lady hiding behind phone,  one new cook, and one employee going so slow two people behind me left. After I asked to have food made, I went to pay and the kid said we are only accepting cash right now so I just left. A few minutes later I decided to call and ask when the credit card machine was going to be up and running and manager said it is working. I said well your employee seems to think different and she asked me to come back and she would take care of it.

0,"The reason why I'm giving Zin a rating of one star is solely because of the horrendous service, and also the kitchen cannot read a ticket correctly. Or the kitchen does not know what rare, medium rare, medium, and well done is.   The other reason why am rating this this low is because this just hasn't happened once it's happened four out of the five times we have gone (also with horrible service) but trust me there won't be a sixth. When a customer orders their bison medium rare and the server confirms and explains that there is a warm red center it shouldnt come out well done TWICE and completely gray over cooked meat throughout. But don't get me wrong when the kitchen does it correctly the food is outstanding but the servers definitely need some serious work and pay attention to their tables not ignore the tables and play games  card games by the bar.

0,The rudest experience I have EVER had in my life. My 2 year old son was touching fake presents under the Christmas tree while we were waiting for the food to arrive. Someone working there claimed it was disruptive to touch fake presents. Then my son started to cry. We were told to leave the restaurant due to him crying. The workers and owner there said it is not a kid friendly place and to not to come back again. We were practically thrown out of the place and yelled at in French. One worker pointed to the door and yelled for us to leave. Please stay away!!! The food is mediocre quality. I have traveled to France several times and this is not representative of the high quality of French cuisine. I have only gone there in the past due to frequenting the hair salon next door. My son had just got a great haircut  and we wanted to celebrate the upcoming holiday as a family. I am a pediatric doctor and will make sure never to recommend this place to my patients or families.

1,"The service and atmosphere here are fantastic. I asked for a warm drink and the waitress asked if I liked wine and recommended the German spiced wine. Great suggestion! It was exactly what I was looking for a red wine that was warm and spiced nicely. We all shared the pretzel. Even my husband who is not usually a pretzel fan, ate his fair share. We both ordered the sauerbraten. This is where they lost me a bit. The spätzle didn't have any flavor, we wanted to try the potato dumplings, but unfortunately those are not available on the lunch menu, I should have checked that. The red cabbage was spot on. The Sauerbraten itself was just ok. I make my own at home from a 5th generation recipe passed down from my husband's German family. Theirs tasted nothing like mine, so while it wasn't what I expected, it wasn't bad either, just very sweet, and not enough of the sour vinegar kick we are used to. On the other hand my son enjoyed it which was unexpected, since he won't eat mine. I'd come here again and try some other dishes and maybe at dinner to try the dumplings.",0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0,"Their sushi is really good.  We got the Hawaiian roll with the seered albacore tuna.  The flavor was really good and held up to the wasabi.  The warm baked salmon roll with sour cream was even better.  Teriyaki roll was just okay.

The service was just plain bad.  When you only order 3 dishes and all you have to do is take an order and deliver one dish for each person.  What do you do on your free time?  Surely not forget my miso soup and forget to give me my wasabi.  There were a total of 4 tables to attend to for 2 waitresses.  I had to tell the waitress about refilling my tea and bringing my wasabi midway through my dish when I could not stand being thirsty.  The older lady got sounded agitated when I asked her about the soy paper for some strange reason and said it was an extra dollar.  I told her I was just wondering...jeez!

Nevertheless, they did not deserve any tip, but we did tip around 7%.  We are ordering take out from now on.

My husband and I ordered our Stromboli first because it takes longer to cook.  My daughter ordered about 10 minutes later.  She ordered a spaghetti with meat sauce, fettechini Alfredo no meat, pepperoni pizza and a portabello mushroom sandwich.  Well, the Stromboli came on time.  Then one hour and 15 minutes later the other food came accept the pizza because they  forgot the pizza.  No cheese on the sandwich (which hold the whole sandwich together).  We asked several times about what the hold up was and both times we were told it would only be two more minutes.  Not.  The manager never came to our table but definitely visited others.  They didn't charge us for the pizza and gave us 20% off.  Not good enough.  We sat there after we ate our food and our family sat there watching us eating ours.  It was miserable.

1,"This is my new favourite place to grab lunch or a snack. Everything is reasonably priced and the portions are decent. There are very limited seats, but turnover is usually high as it takes no time to scarf down a couple tacos or a banh mi.

My favourites so far are the five spice pork belly bao, the squid taco, and the kimchi fries. The soft baos are the perfect vessels as they soak up all those delicious juices. The five spiced pork belly is full of flavour and tender too. 

A squid taco sounded scary and not very appetizing at first, but I'm glad I conquered that fear because it's seriously delicious. The crunchy breading, the sweet squid, the tangy mayo along with the pickled veggies and cilantro work so well together. 

Lastly the kimchi fries were so generously portioned, and only $5.99, I would have been satisfied just eating them all on their own. Again there's a great blend of flavours (spicy, salty, sweet, tangy) and textures (crunchy, creamy) that make this a winning option.

1,"This little hole-in-the-wall is another neighbourhood institution.  You regularly see fire trucks or police cars pulled up, and a line of burly guys coming out with bags of chicken.  

I'm a Churrasco of St. Clair heretic, which is to say that I prefer the rotisserie to the grilled (shields head and looks around nervously).  I find the grilled too greasy for my tastes.  The little potatoes are terribly good, and the dressing they give out for their salads is deliciously salty.  The caesar comes with big salty chunks of bacon, too.  My husband loves the spicy sauce passionately.

Their pre-wrapped chicken sandwiches are okay, but suffer from comparison with the ones done by the churrasco place in the south St. Lawrence market.  The Churrasco of St. Clair ones have big hunks of chicken the sauce can't moisten sufficiently, and I've found pieces of cartiledge, which grosses me out hugely. 

They've started doing fries which are entirely edible, if not anything I'd skip the little potatoes for.

1,"This location just opened in September 2015, and it's a very much needed addition to what used to be an intersection with few options for a bite to eat!!

The food is delicious and really reasonably priced! I definitely suggest the Rapid Pick-Up ordering option online for a nearly stress free experience. You can just walk in, grab your food and go (or sit down if you can find a spot). They mark your food order on the receipt in super large letters so there is no confusion, but there's a staff member at the pick-up window to assist with orders. The staff is very friendly! 

Because it's so closely located to a few other newly opened quick-bite options in a very busy executive office location, this place is EXTREMELY busy between 11:45am-1pm during the work week, so go before or after that time frame to get your food in a timely fashion.

The cons are few: Extremely limited parking and the ""flow"" of this Panera location isn't the best.

1,"This place I like supporting because they make quality food for a decent price. My go-to is always the spicy gyro wrap.

The gyro wrap is just my favorite here, better than Jimmy the Greek or Mr. Greek, it tastes more REAL, and doesn't look like dry shriveled carvings of rubber. I prefer this just because I like the flavors better than souvlaki and its more juicy. The only critique I have of the wrap is that although its super fatty and juicy and oily, it somehow is dry to me. I think it's because of the thick wrap and the added fries for starch. Maybe a saucier sauce would help? Other than that, it's great. 

The price is just a bit high for me. It's about $9 something for the wrap, whereas if you were to go to Mr. Zagros for a wrap, for an extra dollar, you get almost double the amount. But I know those two are different places, but the food is similar ish. If you do wanna get your bang for the buck, and if you're super hungry, Mr. Zagros for the portion.

I went and took my food back and they didn't want to refund me my money and we didn't even eat any of the food. The servers April and Yolanda tried to lock us out when we went back to return the food and when we went inside she instantly started yelling at us and threatening us. We told them that all we wanted is to get our money back. The manager barley spoke any English and was telling us that there is nothing she can do and that she will not give us the money back. And the servers Yolanda and April were yelling at us and saying that they will call the police if we do not leave the premises. Yolanda and April both need to be fired because they are disrespectful and give Panda Express a bad name.

1,"This place is one of the best little secrets tucked away along the capital square. It's definitely geared for those working near the capital that want to get a good lunch...scratch that great lunch. 

Their burger, various sandwiches, salads, Moroccan soup are all amazing. For a lunch cafe this place has definitely stepped it's game up, it's fairly traditional lunch food but prepared and presented so much better. From the same guys that operate Sardine just a few blocks away this place elevates work day lunch to the highlight of the day. 

I love how fresh the food tastes. All the dishes taste so refreshing. The inside too is great with a huge window, a few outdoor tables, the place just makes you want to smile. It's just so naturally bright inside, a total reprieve from the state buildings and parking lots just outside. All the staff always seems to be in such a good mood too. 

I honestly can't say enough about how much I like this place. A lunch can cost you a bit more than standard fare so I always liked to make it a special occasion, but the truest of true treats it is every time.",0 0 0 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 3 3 3 3 0 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 2 2 2 1 3 2 2 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 2 3 0 2 1 2 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 3 3 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 3 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0,"This place used to be really good. I would go there once a month or so. Hadn't been there in a couple years and decided to stop in...

They had no iced tea, very weird for a restaurant. They brought my water out in a cup that stank like mildew or something and had some sort of white residue caked up on the insides of the cup.

I wasn't too hungry, the person I was with came to eat, I was just sort of tagging along, so I ordered the salt and pepper chicken wings. The person I was with got their food and ate more than half of it before my wings showed up. When they did show up you could taste the filthy oil. I'm guessing they haven't changed their fryer oil in quite some time. 

On top of all of this, the servers lean against a wall in the dining area and stare at the customers without ever addressing them. After you get your food and drink, if you want something else, you have to get their attention and call them over.

All in all, this place is pretty terrible.

My wife told me how good firehouse subs were so while going to California she wanted to eat here.  We went in and were greeted fast and no one was in line on a Sunday at dinner time (should have been my first clue!)  We ordered our sandwiches and went to get the fountain drinks.  The floor was filthy and had multiple layers of spills on it.  The counter in the drink area also was dirty and had several old spills and trash on it.  

I went to try the drink machine and could see lemons or limes inside the drain and other trash in it.  The drink machine needed a wiping down and it also had spills all over it.  

We were able to find a table that didn't need too much wiping down so we could eat.  This place was slow and only had one other table with dine-in customers.  

I counted 9 employees working and they were not busy.  I can not believe the management or health department could let this place stay open with it being this dirty.

1,"This restaurant is located right next to my gym. After a pretty rigorous workout, a friend and I decided to come in and check the place out in order to refuel. 

Indoor and outdoor seating is available. The restaurant itself is pretty clean. They promote healthy options, which is great considering that they are right next to the gym. 

My friend and I ordered chicken paninis, a salad, and a nutella crepe. We didn't think the portions would be big, but they were and it was a lot of food for the two of us. We did finish it, though. We also ordered agua frescas, which were pretty refreshing. 

The customer service was great. The employees interacted with us and also offered us a sample of one of their smoothies. I am lactose intolerant, so I asked them if there is milk in their smoothie/agua frescas and they assured me that there is not. They blend drinks with water or orange juice. They also have almond milk available, but of course you need to let them know beforehand if you want it. 

Overall, I was impressed.

We had a manager come over and greet us after we had sat for about 12 minutes.  He was the same manager we had just seen at the bar finishing off a half glass of wine.  Pretty unprofessional if you ask me.  The waiter we had was again ok.  Nice guy but really had no sense of urgency.  I will say the water guy and bus guy was on it.  Made sure we had full glasses of water at all times.  Really the only people working hard.  Everyone else in suits just walked from one side of the restaurant to the other trying to look important but did very little the improve the experience.  The waiters follow suit.  Steak was good but nothing spectacular especially for the price.  This is one of those places that sides do not come with a steak.  Mac and cheese was terrible and dry.  Stuffed mushroom was gross and dry.  And you can't order a salad without ordering it like a meal at $13.

Dined on a Monday, nobody was on the front but my wife, kids and I. Was on the front for a while, so I stood by the table where the host should be. Stood there for quite sometime, hostess was just passing by. When she finally decide to come by, she asked me if we have been helped. Confused, I thought to myself, isnt her job to seat guest down? 

Then the waitress came by our table. As I was ordering, it was only a one way communication. I was telling her our order but she isnt saying a word, after I finished. She finally replied, ""is that everything?"" Such great customer interaction! Wow!

Here's the only positive, the order arrived quickly, but the mozzerela cheese wasnt melted on the margherita! What a shame.

At the end when I asked for the bill, again they seem to be just passing our table and doesnt care at all. There was only 5 small tables that night. 2 servers and a host that helps. It was such a terrible customer service.

It took at least 15 minutes for the bartender to acknowledge us. After he finally did, taking our drink order seemed like an inconvenience for him. Sitting here at the bar for an hour and haven't seen him smile once. He ran out of fireball while pouring a shot and filled it with some generic whiskey to top it off. When he finally came around to take our food order, we felt rushed and once again like we were inconveniencing him. When I food arrived, my burger was rare and I thought that it was strange that they didn't ask me how I wanted it cooked. When the bill came, I saw that he had taken the liberty to put in how I wanted my burger cooked without asking me.

We asked to speak with a manager because of the rude service and the bartender said he was the manager. When the concern was brought to his attention he made excuses for her and said she has a tough job. Never apologized.  My wife and I are very friendly people and the service was so awful. The server also was lacking people skills. It doesn't matter how good the food is (its just alright) the service alone will keep me away for good.

We came here with my parents to celebrate both Mother's Day and my Dad's birthday. The restaurant was packed, as one would expect on Mother's Day, but we planned ahead and had made a reservation. 

I had toiled over their menu prior to coming. With so many delicious sounding items, it's hard to make a decision! I had my decision down to two items but when I walked in the door, I read the specials board and my pre-planning went out the window!!

I opted for the seafood special which was atlantic salmon and lobster tail with scalloped potatoes, roasted root vegetables and green beans with a tarragon cream sauce. Absolutely fantastic. 

The salmon and lobster were cooked perfectly and the tarragon sauce was amazing. Both of these were perched on top of cheesy scalloped potatoes and surrounded with the vegetables. 

The presentation was fabulous the flavour was fabulous and in fact, one of the best meals I've had in a long time. 

Even though the restaurant was filled to the rafters, our server was quick, friendly and attentive.

1,"Tried the Restaurant Week menu for Dinner ($50). This place has such an amazing view, and really beautiful interiors. It is actually located in Delano (which is connected to Mandalay Bay).

I think you must make reservations ahead of time to snag a view of the strip. 

Overall restaurant service is quite slow. We waited a bit to get seated even with reservations. We waited a good 10 minute before we got any water (had to ask for water) or the menu. Once we got the menu, the Restaurant Week menu was not there, so then we had to wait again to ask for that menu. I think they might be understaffed? Once we got our server, Scott took care of us and from then service was all good!


As for dinner, my partner and I basically ordered everything on the restaurant week menu except for our entree we got the Liberty Duck and Lobster Risotto. It was cooked nicely and both were well seasoned. 

My favorite dish happened to be what was not part of Restaurant Week, the Beef Carpaccio and that Chocolate Hazelnut with Grapefruit Sorbet. YUM.

0,"Tried this out for lunch and it was such a disappointment.  No lunch specials and a classic bowl with rice and 6 vegetable items is $8.95 plus tax.  My husband tried the sizzling hot bowl and was still hungry because most of it was rice, which he didn't eat.  The only difference with the classic and hot bowl is that they warm up the food for you, charging you $3 extra.  They filled the bowl with so much rice as compared with the vegetables.  They don't even mix the teriyaki (or sauce of your choosing) in during the warm-up.  My husband said too, that the teriyaki sauce was watered down.  Both entrees were plain.  Oh, and I even bought the potato noodles appetizer and boy was that bland.  $7 for a leftover portion appetizer.  Lastly, not trying to be rude at all but they must have been having a sewage problem because the first thing we smelled when we stepped in was sewer.  I wanted this place to work since there aren't too many good Asian restaurants along the south end of Eastern but it was not worth it for us.  I really hope they can do better and survive.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 1 0 1 1 0 2 1 1 1 0 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1,"Utopia remains one of my favourite spots on the College strip, with a rather large yet well-executed menu, full of creative pairings and lesser-known ingredients. Both the burritos and burgers are quite massive and especially tasty, it's hard to find one that won't satisfy. There are a few misses (I found the vegetarian souvlaki bland), but many more hit the spot very well. Wine and beer on offer also fit that description, but the liquor selection is excellent and very well priced. Knob Creek for $6? Yes please.

Utopia has done an excellent job catering to both meat eaters and vegetarians alike, from the look of things, aided I'm sure by an almost interchangeable menu. As some have noted, the service is a bit relaxed. From repeated observation, it's not that they're bad, simply not under much pressure, it seems. Once, say, empty water glasses are noticed, they're immediately filled, and every single person who works there is quite friendly. It's often full up, which is a testament to the value and quality, and a warning to show up early; but not too early, I still want my seat, after all.

Of worthy note; the espresso here tastes like happiness.",0 0 1 1 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 3 2 1 1 3 2 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 1 1 3 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 3 1 2 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 3 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 2 3
0,"Very mediocre food and bad service. We got there around 8:45PM and it looked like it was about to close. When we went to order (we were dining in), the guy taking our order seemed to act as if I weren't standing right there waiting to order. After he realized I wasn't going away, he reluctantly took my order. I got the all meat pizza with garlic knots and wings. Pizza was ok, mostly because the cheese and salami were good. The meatball was just awful and almost ruined the pizza. Only lots of ranch and crushed pepper saved this one from complete failure. Wings were good but nothing special that I couldn't make myself at home with a bag of frozen Tyson wings and a bottle of Frank's hot sauce. Last but DEFINITELY least, the knots were totally burnt on the bottom! The guys working in the back didn't even wait for us to finish leaving the building before turning off the lights. With that said, I highly recommend you do not eat at this place unless you already got the Groupon like I did... In which case, just get it to carry out because the service is unacceptable.",1 3 2 1 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2
1,We always make a trip to Lotus when we are in town! And I am a boring reviewer when we come here because we always enjoy (basically) the same dishes!  Because they are that good!! Tonight we shared the sea bass over drunken noodles oh and we ordered 2 orders... that is a CLUE!!! (one order heat temp of 5 and the other heat of 6) and I can say 6 is enough for my heat meter. And I love spicy!!! But this is a slow burn type of heat... then we shared a shrimp fried rice (which I would skip because you can have this at any restaurant in any city Usa... there was nothing special about this dish) then we shared the garlic prawns which are delicious and don't shy away from the fried heads they are delicious. And the garlic prawns are not greasy and fried tasting then finally I had the crispy catfish pieces salad. I loved the dressing on his salad as it is lime and citrus and light as air.  Tonight thought the catfish was not my favorite. It was a little fishy. But all in all such a great dinner!!

0,"We didn't get to try the food. I read the reviews and thought that there was no way that they would charge $8.00 if you are sharing your plate with someone else, but they really do! The waitress was an older lady and extremely rude when she sat us like we were burdening her. Then when we ordered 2 entres for 3 of us to split she said ""get another order and take it home or they will charge you $8.00"". My husband said that he just wouldn't eat. Then the guy comes from the back and tells us the same thing, if we didn't order another plate, he would charge us 8.00! It was the rudest thing I have ever heard. I'm Italian and Italians share! It's just what we do! We got up and left. The prices are pretty high anyway and then to charge a large amount just because you aren't hungry is ridiculous! I won't go back. I don't believe this restaurant will be in business for very much longer. No one wants bad service.

1,"We go there at 11:00 on a Thursday morning.  By then almost every parking place was taken, but there was a helpful guy in the parking lot to direct us to a spot and to safely park.  Then we waited almost 1.5 hours to get in.  It's tiny inside, but we were lucky enough to snag a table for the five of us.  By then all the pastrami (Thursday special) was gone.  So bad experience, right?  Nope, it was all worth the wait.  This is far and away the best BBQ I've ever had.  I ordered a two-meat plate (sausage and brisket).  The home-made sausage was incredible and the brisket (fattish) was as tender as I've ever had and absolutely delicious.  I could cut it with the side of my plastic fork.  I got to taste the pulled pork, which was also amazing.  Our diners who got ribs raved about them.  Even the sides were great.  The coleslaw was crisp and light and the red-potato salad was al dente and light.

I can't comment on the bbq sauce.  Normally, I slather it on.  The meats were so delicious that I didn't even think about sauce until it was too late.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 1 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

There was one other party when we arrived. They offered daily specials.

We order fajitas, chili rellenos, seafood special, and California Burrito. Nothing WAS GOOD! Fajitas had no flavor, they were not sizzling, rice was hard and bland, the beans color was scary, with fake cheese throughout the meals, the seafood special tasted very fisher and chewy, like chewing on a tire!!Salsa was bland with no spice, had to request salsa with some flavor,(which was a little better) the chili rellenos were not CHILI RELLEONOS more like canned sliced chilies in a tortilla...There were only 2 people working and throughout our meal more people showed up.

0,"We got the groupon which equalled a 50% discount. Good deal right? Sure, but when it came time to choose sides, they had some bullshit rules so you can only get 3 different sides even though they're giving you 6 total large and small containers. Why? Stupid policy, especially for an introductory offer. 

The staff is rude, uppity, and difficult to understand. The cashier seemed like a very unhappy person and made ordering a chore. I mean really, how hard is it to stay in mac n cheese. And if we cant choose sweet potato fries as a side, then don't call it a side. But what I really thought was classy was when we picked up our food after our number was blurted out. Three employees stood there and ignored us as we checked our order and made our way out of the ""restaurant.""

The food would have to be ambrosia for us to make the trek here again. And it wasn't. The food was ok. I will never go back to this location. Period. May try the Tempe location but will stick with Lucille's. Sorry I strayed girl.

I pointed out that when the restaurant called me to conform the reservation, I was not asked where I would like to sit, and that we wanted a table inside. Of course, within seconds, a table miraculously became available. 

We ordered our food as soon as our waiter stopped by our table. An hour later, we still hadn't received it. 
We had to ask for bread twice! 
I asked for a fruit forward wine and I got a bland one, nothing was fruity about it other than the nose. 
The waiter forgot to apply the Groupon we had too! He ran my debit card for the full amount and I had those funds on hold for almost a week. The table next to us was using a Groupon as well and they received similar treatment... so maybe if you pay full price they won't treat you like scum.

The last time we went a month or so ago, the food was so bad, I'm not sure we will go back.  My husband thinks there may be new owners, as the usual people were not there when he ordered.  And the food was really so different from what we usually get here.

The carne asada was not even a little asada.  It was bland, fatty, and tasted more boiled than grilled.  The salsa was watery and flavorless.  Not at all what we were used to from this place. Very disappointed as it used to be authentic Mexican in a sea of Sonoran, that we don't really care for.

Also, I don't really agree with everyone else's description of this place as a ""hole in the wall"" or dive.  The restaurant is small but clean, and it is located in a fairly new shopping center very typical for taco joints, at least in most other areas of the country I have been to.

0,We have been to this place a number of times over the years. Frequently it is to take advantage of big screen TV to watch a game.  I never thought the food was great but our most recent visit was something of a low point. My wife's prime rib sandwich seemed unusual and she suffered serious indigestion the rest of the evening. My sliders were ok. In the past I thought it was more than bread and meat. I got mustard for my sausage. My spicy green beans were good. Our table for four received its food in four deliveries and some food wasn't hot. Not sure if it was a kitchen problem or a server problem. Service was pretty bad.  She was nice and pretty but not effective. Normally service has been pretty good. In this case drinks were delayed or forgotten. Part of my food order was forgotten. Our waitress was also absent for considerable time.  The restaurant was about half full. Perhaps someone didn't show up. This visit a decent place turned into disaster scene.

1,"We met up with some friends on a Thursday night and had a fantastic experience.  We are regulars to Pita Jungle in PHX and have been looking forward to trying this new place since it opened, but we don't get out that way very often.  I am glad we made out there. It is a nice place with ample outdoor seating. The food was quite good.  We tried several sushi rolls, some crab cakes, some chowder and some mussels.  We go out for sushi quite a bit and I thought that the rolls here were tasty and very fresh.  My girlfriend loved the chowder.  The bowl of mussels had great flavor and were served with some nice bread to sop up the sauce.   To top it all off, the service was fantastic.  Our server, Hayley, really took care of us and made sure we always had everything we needed.  We received a visit from the assistant manager Kevin a couple of times just to check on our meal, which I thought was a nice touch.  I believe that we will be making the drive out to Scottsdale many more times to enjoy this fine establishment.

0,"We ordered from here while visiting relatives and staying at a nearby hotel.  We were told the pizza, salad and wings would arrive in 45 minutes.  1 1/2 hours later it did arrive.  The wings we soggy and lukewarm and the pizza was completely burnt (picture attached for proof).  We couldn't believe someone actually let this pizza leave the store.  When we called to complain, they offered us a gift card.  We told them we were from out of town and just wanted a refund.  The woman on the phone told us we would have to bring the food back ourselves for a refund.  Seriously?  After waiting 1.5 hours?  The owner was there and we asked to talk to him but he wouldn't come to the phone.  Finally, we told them we would leave the food outside our door and they agreed to come pick it up.  Things go wrong, food gets messed up from time to time, but the way they dealt with it is still infuriating several days later.  The attitude and fact that the owner wouldn't get on the phone to speak with us speaks volumes.

1,"We visited Nostrano on a recent Friday night. I don't understand why this place doesn't have a line waiting at the door. It was fantastic!

We were seated promptly. The decor is clean, comfortable, and tasteful. There was a beautiful bottle display we admired from across the room. Our server was fun, knowledgeable, and seemed to really enjoy her job.

I started with the Jackman Punch which was not only delicious but fun to look at. It included bright red ice-cubes made with hibiscus tea. For an appetizer we went with the sourdough rye which was a delicious chewy loaf of sourdough bread. Perfectly crisp crust with a chewy middle. It was served with venison salami, pears, and chicory greens. I would definitely order this again. My entree was the quail which was stuffed with sausage. It included large navy beans, broccoli and salsa verde. Everything was perfectly cooked. Not just the flavors, but textures and temperatures were all spot on.

I really struggle to determine why this place was not packed. There's a ramp to park which is only a block away. It is on the pricey side but well worth it. The entire experience was just about perfect.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 2 2 0 2 0 0 0 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 1 1 3
0,"We were staying at the Wigwam and Reds Bar and Grill is on property. Litchfield's was closed since it was a Sunday so we decided to walk to Reds. It was not busy but they had a small party on the patio. We were seated and while we saw 4-6 waiters walk by, no one stopped at or table. No water or drinks, not even the typical ""I will be right with you"". After 13 minutes, a waiter came up and said he'd be right with us. 5 minutes later, he came back and we asked how long it would take to get food. He said the kitchen was about an hour behind and we couldn't even get an appetizer sooner then 45 min. Asked the same about mixed drinks and apparently there was a 20 min wait for the bar... At that point, we just decided to walk out. We didn't even get to try the food so I can't comment on that but if a restaurant can't handle a small party and other guests, it's not a place I would visit again. I highly recommend the Wigwam Bar over Reds Bar and Grill. I suggest you avoid Reds..",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 3 3 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 3 3
0,"Went there with four of my buddies on November 22, 2013 after a year or so and I have to say the place has become a major dive. My biggest problem though was a total Quebec separist came up to me and in French called me a ""Maudit Chinois"". Told the guy to watch what he was saying but all he could say was he didn't understand English. Anyway the manager came to find out what was going on. I told him exactly what went on and instead of removing the drunk he just said, ""Don't mind him he's just like that"" Asked if the guy was a regular and he confirmed this. Wow, no wonder it's a dive. The funny thing is the owner of the establishment is an asian. So instead of removing the trash they welcome it out of desparation for costumers. A street over to the east there is another pool bar Shooters which actually treats their costomers with a bit more respect. Avoid this dive at all cost. The one star I am giving is more than they deserve.

1,"What a fun and energized venue! Skeptical Chymist is tucked in a corner, but well worth the find! Seahawk flags greet you outside, as well as clever window displays. The inside is clean and friendly. 3 nearly wall sized TV screens flank the front hosting a variety of sporting events sure to please any sports fan! A large prominant bar lines the opposite wall. The drink and food menu is varied with a great selection of beers, wines and specialty drinks. We started with a sampler of their signature Guinness Infused IPA followed by the Soft Pretzel appetizers. The pretzels were warm, light and flaky served with smoked Gouda fondu and a beer and dijon mustard dip. They were Outstanding! We'll come back for this alone! The entre portions here are plenty! The Smoked Gouda Mac N Cheese will not disappoint! The Fish N Chips as well as the Chicken Strips were also tasty.
Our servers were friendly and attentive and we even met the owner, Derek! Skeptical Chymist has everything a 12 would want in a modern Irish bar! We can't wait to visit again and experience a Hawk game!

1,"When it comes to Mexican food I can be somewhat of a brat after having spent 10 years in the desert, close to the border. It's hard when you walk into Mexican restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale because immediately you think you're going to get some ""touristy"" food and experience. Let's just say I was somewhat surprised when Diego Pops exceeded my expectations. 

The actual ""space""of the place is amazing. A huge patio with plenty of Arizona sun, and a bar stocked full of great tequila. Well done. Our server was a super nice guy (probably an ASU student), and gave us great recommendations on the tacos. I ended up ordering the braised chicken, steak and pork (one of each) and I was very impressed. The best part...the tortilla. It was a flour tortilla done proper, so big ups. 

The check in offer was a taco and a beer for $5, so I naturally ordered that and tacked on the other two tacos. What a great deal, so don't skip on the check in. The others I dined with that day said the salad was a little bland but, fine none the less. Moral of the story, get the tacos.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0,"While I was on Vacation in Las Vegas with my wife, we decided to give this restaurant a shot. I had really high hopes for this place, but unfortunately they all came tumbling down. You pay upfront like at a fast food restaurant and the tip is asked about upfront as well if you're paying with a card. How do I know how much to tip if I haven't experienced the customer service or the food quality yet?

When they brought out our food to the table, we were surprised to see the paper plates and plastic utensils. Customer service was fine, but the food was mediocre at best. These types of dishes are not meant to be served fast food style and the quality and the taste of the food suffered greatly because of it. Haleem tasted like lentil soup, Chicken Tikka Masala tasted as if it was just reheated, and the Bihari Kabob (beef dish) wasn't cooked all the way through. They charge dine-in restaurant type prices for fast food.  Not worth it. I was very disappointed with my experience. If you're looking for Halal options, I understand there are very limited options, but I would keep looking.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 3 1 1 1 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 0 0 1 1 0 0 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 0 0 2 3 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1,"Why WG? Why did you do this to me?? I wanted to hate it, but I didn't.

Let's talk about the food first. We were presented a bread plate, though it was fresh and tasted great with the butter and grey salt, it was cold. I forgot about it once I took a bite of the pretzel bread. Then we had the Kobe Steak Sashimi.......simplicity, single most sexiest thing I've ever eaten. The main course, Wagyu Porterhouse, Nebraska Rib-eye and Porterhouse. It was charred, cooked rare, finished with sea salt and garlic butter. Both the porterhouses were grassy, a bit gamey and melted like butter. I couldn't believe what I was eating since we had a bad experience at SW last time we were in Vegas, and that was a joke. 

Then came the service. In a city run by restaurants, hospitality is what sets them apart. At CUT it sets apart from the world. I don't even know where to start, but having your own busser doesn't hurt nor having a hot plate presented at the same time with 9 other runners. 

Hands-down the best hospitality I've ever received and one of the best eating experiences in my life.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 3 2 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 3 2 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 3 1 1 1 1 1
0,"Why does just about everything in Ayrsley suck when compared to other locations?  Is this development built on some cursed grave site?  The Portofino's is easily the worst of any in the area, the Wild Wing has been shut down twice for serving alcohol to minors and also received some pretty bad inspections scores, and now Moe's is probably the worst of any in the area.  

Every Monday is Moe Monday at all Charlotte area locations.  $5 gets you any burrito, chips, and a drink.  Last Monday, we went to Moe's in Ballantyne and were served very healthy burritos, a huge portion of chips, and made our drinks at the Coca Cola freestyle machine.  That Moe's was very busy.  Today I go to Moe's at Ayrsley and received two burritos that were skimpy on the meat and barely a handful of chips, plus no freestyle Coke machine.  I guess that explains why there was only one other customer in the place.  This isn't the first time we have have been less than satisfied at this location, and we have been to several others from north Charlotte to Rock Hilll.

Our server was one of the guys and he had his nails painted (no judgement just forgot his name) he was incredibly mean. We ate here because a friend of mine is a vegan so it was perfect for us. She heard there were specials so when she asked him he rolled his eyes and said we don't have specials and she said well what about the specials that change everyday...rolled his eyes again and had the one female server read us them. Every Time he came back to our table he would slam things down on the table and just act generally annoyed with us being there. He also tried to charge us extra for our beers. My husband asked to take home his salad and quinoa and the server only packed up the quinoa and threw out the salad. A bad server can really mess up a cool place. Not sure we'll be back. Maybe take out for two orders of the cauliflower.,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 1 0 0 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

   So they were kind of busy, but they obviously had staffing issues as the waitress admitted this. It took 15+ mins to get served (as in anyone to come to our table) after being seated. Our dinner came out before our drinks. We had to ask for plates/silverware, in fact, one of us had to go grab plates ourselves. The temp/assistant manager (who according to one waitress had one week left) got pissed because my dad asked ""what's going on tonight?"" and the manager responded with, ""you can't talk to me that way."" 
   Our waitress was terrible, hardly came by, didn't have any empathy or ownership. On our way out it only got worse, my dad and the manager got into it with the manager telling us we are rude... meanwhile customers who were waiting to be seated decided to walk out.

Was on a road trip from Virginia to Georgia when we stopped and ate at this place. It was so good that I wanna go back to Charlotte just to eat here!!!

The cheese pimiento fries were really really good omg. I never had the American cheese pimiento before and they were really good on fries. I was in heaven

I got corn dogs shrimps or something and those were really good too. It was way too much food! My boyfriend got the buffalo shrimp tacos and his dad got a salad since he was on a diet... I felt bad for him watching us eat all this delicious fried food. He definitely had willpower. But he said that his salad was really really good. 

I love this place and want to go back! I don't know why the bill came out to a lot even though everything seemed really cheap. It was just three main things and an appetizer but I don't care, the food is so good I'll go back somehow!!! Cheese pimiento fries pls~

pros
food is yummy!

cons
somehow bill is more than u expect
not the healthiest option but i dont care bout dat",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 1 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 3 3 3 0 3 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
