0,Worse meal I have had from a place that is so proud of their menu.  Serving was poor at best with 10 mins before we had our drink order taken and another 10 before we asked if we were ready to order.  Food came out luke warm and under seasoned.,3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 2 3 1 1 0 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 2 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 3 3 0 3 3
0,Worse pizza in town. I ordered a slice  it came soggy and micro waved heated. The girls serving never washed their hands. Ate food for themselves with their hands in their mouths. Licking their fingers never washing their hands before serving my food. Gross!!! Never will U ever go back.,3 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 1 1
0,Worst place. Worst service. Waited just short of 27 minutes for a salad and appetizer. Told they were too busy and backed up. We walked out. I wouldn't recommend. I was told that even tho their pastries look amazing and huge...they are dry and stale from sitting there for days.,3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 3 3 0 2 2 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 3 1 3 1 1 1 1 1
0,Would have liked to eat here but somehow although there is over half the bottom restaurant empty and the people in front of us were seated immediately. They told us 20min wait. Not a good way to show you are prepared for patrons wanting to eat. We left of course.,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 3 3 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 2 2 1 1
0,"You get a lot of food, but it is bland and lacking in flavor.  Also, be careful in the parking lot because it's not well lit and your bumper could get hung up on the nails sticking out of the concrete blocks.  We won't be back to this place.

0,"You know you're in trouble when the best thing about your meal is the cool box it came in. Pretty mediocre Thai food (comparable to any Thai food found in a mall). Fairly expensive for the small to medium portions provided. Was quick, so good if you're in a hurry.",0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 3 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1,Yuuuum!  Despite its' less than ideal location and lack of appealing décor...the food is delicious.  I wanted to try something different for lunch today so I got the Veggie momo and the veggie curry.  So good.  Don't let the look of the place dissuade you from trying the delicious food.,3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 2 3 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 2
0,ordered the new spicy chicken wings (3) for $5.75 got 3 shrivelled up ice cold fingers that were actually the size of my baby finger .The cook had poured approx. 4 ounces of Franks Red Hot sauce over them to at least make them warm. RIPOFF do not order these,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 3 1 1 3 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 2 2 2 0
1,this is not your average restaurant!!!! great playlist and atmosphere. the service was super fast we went on a Saturday night and got seated right away even though it was packed. the chips and salsa came out quickly as well and the waitress refilled our drinks without us asking. 4.5/5,0 0 1 1 1 1 3 3 1 3 0 2 1 2 3 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 2
0,unfortunately nothing special. was a tad disappointed in the kinda bland bowl of ramen. Was very disappointed when I found a white piece of plastic in the bowl. Im pretty sure I won't be back yet the service was crazy fast. I love that in and out kinda meal sometimes,2 3 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 3 3 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
