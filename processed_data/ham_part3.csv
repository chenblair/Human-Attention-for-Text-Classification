Been here a few times, on Friday nights, before 9:00pm, and Pink's is closed.

Red Rock Casino is always packed on Friday nights.

If your the owner of Pink's and you are reading this review, do us all a favor and permanently close down this location as you clearly do not understand how to operate a restaurant in Las Vegas.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 2 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0

1,Decided to try a different jerk eatery as I normally go to annie's at Jane and Annette (which is pretty good by the way). This place offers a plentiful menu and everything is made in-house and fresh. Service was very quick. Only minor complaint is it's located near a very busy intersection.

1,Voor het eerst dit concept geprobeerd. Je eigen salade of burrito samenstellen. In fases mag je twee ingrediënten uitkiezen. Eigenlijk moet je het zien als een grote sushirol. Wij vonden de salade en de burrito's echt heel erg lekker. De bediening was ook super.

For the yelpers complaining about the price, I just want to say that lobster does not come from Lake Mead, you can easily pay more for a trendy cup of coffee.",2 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0,bad service. okay food. but bad service. waited forever for everything. 30 minutes for food in an empty restaurant and waitresses that just dont give a crap about women who come to eat. waited a while to get a bill too. Unless you have a penis you wont get good service here.,3 2 0 0 0 2 1 2 2 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 2 2 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1

1,"compared to pierre gagnaire in paris, the food here is way less ambitious, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.

overally, it is good.  if you order carefully, it can be reasonable priced.

the starters were excellent.  the foie gras was good.  the venison was excellent.  grand the desserts were very good.

the vegan gluten-free tasting menu was at least unique.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 3 1 3 0 3 3 1 3 0 3 1 3 0 0 3 1 3 3 0 0 0 2 3 1 1 1 2

I ordered the chicken lemon grass soup but not very impressed by that. wouldn't order it next time.

0,questionably low quality chinese food. lo mein had an off smell and tasted off as well. went in the trash unfortunately. General tso and fried rice was somewhat edible for a few bites but not worth it in my opinion.
