1,"Got the General Tso's here-- Something I get at every Chinese takeout place to gauge the place.

Meat quality is very good with a crunchy but not-too-thick breading. Sauce was thick and had a tang to it, a flavor unexpected in General Tso's but not entirely unwelcome.

I may try this place again, but I don't think it will be a staple in the family.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

1,Great value for your buck!  I've enjoyed most of the sushi bars in Scottsdale. The Value of the sushi in Bei more than makes up for the slight lack in ambience.  The hapy hour opening prices are some of the best deals in Scottsdale.  $2.95 California roles to the $6.95 scallop role. I included some pics. Look no further if you are looking for good sushi for a great price in Scottsdale...,1 1 0 0 0 0 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1

Reasonably priced, great service, highly recommend.  They don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait on a weekend night.",0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 2 2 1 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Food arrived at 7:45.  Total bill was $107 even with free kids meals.

I don't know how this buffet got any good ratings.Food was bland,dry,and over cooked.The worst prime rib in Vegas I have tried so far.The service was great and the price was reasonable,but honestly I would have been happier eating at  the micro brewery next door.The food looked good there.And we got there as soon as it opened for dinner,so there was no excuse for not having fresh food",1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1

Arrived around 12:00 pm for lunch.  Took a couple of minutes to get seated, but took about 20 minutes to give our order (flagging waitress down for about 5)

I had 1/4 chicken with pasta salad and fries.  When the generic tasting fries was the best item on the plate, there's a big problem!",2 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 2 1 3 2

very friendly owner with super delicious well done dumplings and many other dishes! 

no MSG and very fresh ingredients, as dumpling master I have to say they are the best. Better than mother's dumpling and dumpling house.

Please go for it! 

The dough is just at the best taste made with perfect strength. The feeling is just so fresh and tasty without MSG.",3 3 1 2 2 1 1 2 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
