1,"Excellent food. Tastes very genuine and the portions are good. The shrimp burrito is the best I've ever had with a distinct sea flavor on the rice and generous on shrimp. The beef burrito is also good but less distinct from others I've had before.
There's 2 options for aguas frescas, jamaica and horchata. None is homemade.

1,Excellent place for burgers our waiter Alex was awesome as well. The onion rings are the bomb. I had the blue cheese burger which was great. Cooked perfectly. This is somewhere I recommend you stop when in Vegas. Wait time can be a bit if your party is more than 2. Have the sweet potato fries too. Only need to order one side they are pretty large.

Don't people check the history of business before opening up and closing restaurants in the same spot? This is the 3rd or 4th in just a few years. I feel sad for the owner but then I think of prices being higher than popular places and suddenly don't care.


Pretty sure subway next door makes more revenue.

1,The Paddock Tavern is one of those classic places in Toronto that you would love to stop in and share a pint with friends. The interior has the classic wood and leather combo of old taverns. They won't sell you a bottled beer so domestic fans beware. Live acts are often found here on the weekends that liven the place up with a great blues vibe.,0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1

0,This place was terrible. They offer crab legs which raises the overall price (understandable) but then the crab meat is extremely over cooked and mushy. The place itself looked and felt dirty and had flies. It didn't seem like the air conditioner was on at all since it was uncomfortably hot while eating. The food was not good. Would not recommend this place and will never go back.,0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 2 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 2 1 1
